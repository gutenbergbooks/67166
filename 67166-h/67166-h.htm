</div><!--chapter-->

<p><i>It is because of a personal and practical experience of the advantage to be gained by the
possession of a knowledge of drawing, that the author is prompted to undertake the rather pleasant
task of producing a self-help book relating to the subject.</i></p>

<p><i>Since the days of youthful endeavor, the author has passed through an extended experience
of mechanical life, and scarcely ever without chalk, pencil or instrument in hand, to illustrate by
sketch or drawing, the tools to be employed, or to picture the finished product; accordingly,
throughout this work, words of explanation and the drawings will go together to aid the diligent
student.</i></p>

<p><i>It has been said by an eminent writer, that “one workman is superior to another&mdash;other
circumstances being the same&mdash;directly in proportion to his knowledge in drawing, and those who
are ignorant of it must in many respects be subservient to others who have obtained that knowledge.”</i></p>

<p><i>It has been also said that no man is fitted to be foreman of a shop who cannot draw, and
it is generally true that no one will be appointed to that position, except temporarily, who does
not possess some knowledge of the art, either “freehand” or instrumental.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page14">[14]</span></p>

<p><i>It is a question how far a good working knowledge of drawing can be attained without a
teacher; it is true that but few have become proficient without such aid, but it is equally true
that “self-help” has been the key note to all advancement.</i></p>

<p><i>The author received personal instruction in several ways and times, at home, in school, in
an architect’s office, and under an experienced mechanical engineer, but it was in the early morning
hours of a bright summer time&mdash;lang syne&mdash;that he made his first serious attempt to master the
art of mechanical drawing. It was a struggle and a battle to hold himself down to “the board”
to the finish, but it was a victory&mdash;one, won over slothfulness and impatience, and of such a
nature as to warrant the use of the term “self-help” to the encouragement of others.</i></p>

<p><i>In conclusion two sentiments may be added; if a good working knowledge of drawing is
“worth the while” then, 1, the student should be thoroughly in earnest in acquiring it; 2, he
should be willing to take sufficient time and give much hard study to gain the skill necessary for
success.</i></p>

<p><i>This persistence is not irksome. It carries its own reward, and the results are definite
and sure.</i></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Introduction.</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>Drawing is one of the arts; art relates to something to be done, and art in the industrial and mechanical
sense aims chiefly at utility, and is governed by exact rules; hence mechanical drawing&mdash;so-called&mdash;tends first to
be useful and helpful, and second to accuracy in execution, including most minute details; it aspires to the
perfection of nature in adaptability of the means to the end.</p>

<p>Drawing constitutes a universal language, to acquire which is a matter of importance, for by its use one is
able to illustrate the form and dimensions of an object, device, or utility, in very much less time, and far more
clearly, than by a verbal description.</p>

<p>To a person who may not be able perfectly to understand the language of a country, to be able to draw is
an aid and a safeguard; to use the words of Sir Joshua Reynolds, “the pencil speaks the language of every land.”</p>

<p>In extensive iron works and metal-working establishments the designer and draughtsman is always in
demand. His services are indispensable and his position is a highly responsible one. It becomes his
pecial<span class="pagenum" id="Page16">[16]</span>
province to design improvements, to furnish sketches and to make finished drawings; to calculate strains, strength,
power, motion, weight, friction and durability. All this and much more is the professional draughtsman’s work.</p>

<p>In “directory” classification, he who accomplishes such comprehensive results as above described is termed
a “Draughtsman,” but the word has as wide a meaning as “Engineer,” which takes in civil, mechanical, naval,
sanitary, steam and other engineering specialists. So, in drafting, it includes the office boy employed in making
blue prints, it embraces the copyists, tracers and assistants, as well as the head draughtsman and chief engineer.</p>

<p>Consequently the range is wide, and the line hard to draw between draughtsmen who work with their
hands, and those who work with their brains. It may be added that the best men are too frequently undervalued,
owing to the unavoidable difficulty in distinguishing the difference in true worth, between the two widely separated
classes.</p>

<p>It may be remarked that they only draw well who draw intelligently; aptness in this, as in many other
virtues, is a matter of slow growth, “here a line and there a line”&mdash;it’s the proper direction, not the rate of
progress, that counts in the end.</p>

<p>There are several methods of drawing&mdash;1, Free-hand; 2, Instrumental; 3, Geometrical; 4. Perspective.
In the first the work, also termed sketching, is executed by pencil, pen, crayon, or even paint-brush; in the second
the result is attained by the use of rule, tee-square, drawing pen, etc.; this method is also denominated
mechanical drawing, and suggests the title of this volume.</p>

<p>The great usefulness, not to say necessity, of readiness in executing accurately, drawings “to scale,”
is<span class="pagenum" id="Page17">[17]</span>
emphasized by the fact that now, more than ever, is all machinery designed, and it may almost be said, is “built,”
in the draughting room&mdash;this is a valuable hint relating to “reading” drawings.</p>

<p>It is wise, as well as easy, to begin at the beginning of things; thus, it is altogether the good part to mount
a ladder by the first and second rounds rather than to attempt it by taking the third, sixth, ninth, etc.&mdash;especially
are first and second rounds the very best to start upon; “Chalk-work,” is the first subject introduced,
next, that of “Free-hand.” These are the first steps leading upward in this most agreeable attainment&mdash;skill
in illustrating and designing of objects, tools, and utilities.</p>

<p>A single word of advice before introducing the elementary work connected with mechanical drawing: if
the student should experience difficulty in mastering the diagrams and curves abounding in this book, let him
consult an experienced draughtsman or teacher, who, by a few strokes of a lead pencil, can easily make them plain;
that knowledge&mdash;which cannot be printed or self-taught&mdash;termed <i>the Craftsman’s Art</i>, is communicated largely by
personal telling and showing, from man to man; in drawing, this help should be thankfully availed of, when
necessity arises.</p>

<div class="note">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Sketching is often in demand because there is no time for finished or careful drawings, and the one who can draw a few
lines in a moment to let a sudden necessity be known, is the man of the hour. All candidates for First Class Engineer’s Certificates in
marine service in the navy have to undergo an examination in rough drawing; this is intended not so much as a proof of the applicant
possessing the capability of a draughtsman, but in the event of any injury to the engines in his charge, so that he may be able to send to
his Superintendent a rough drawing of the particular part, properly dimensioned, so that it could be worked from, and time saved on the
arrival of the ship at the port where the repairs are to be done.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">The Plan of the Work.</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>The purpose or scope of this work may be briefly stated: It is to aid the aspiring student in making the first
advance towards a thorough and useful knowledge of drawing in its several divisions, as elsewhere defined.</p>

<p>The method to be followed in presenting the subject will be the natural order clearly and simply defined,
as “from the less to the greater.”</p>

<p>The first subject to be discussed comes under the heading of chalk-work, <i>i. e.</i>, such drawings as can be
executed on a blackboard, a floor, or even on more primitive surfaces, such as a smooth stone or board.</p>

<p>This is indeed a lowly beginning, but the author is quite confident it will awaken as much interest as any part
of the book&mdash;even in the most experienced in the art of drawing, as to them it will revive the ambitions and first
crude attempts made in the golden days of their youth.</p>

<p>Let it be clearly understood by all, and especially by those who wish to learn drawing, that the study of this
delightful art does not require any special qualification. We need only ask one question: Have you learned to
write? If so, be assured you may learn to draw, but to all the same rule applies, first the elements of the art, and
afterwards the more advanced study.</p>

<p>It is not expected that all should exhibit a decided taste for drawing, for the possession of this is rather a gift
of nature than the result of education; but a knowledge of principles and a certain amount of executive ability<span class="pagenum" id="Page22">[22]</span>
may be obtained by every one of average capacity, and whatever the natural power may be, it will be increased
and developed by exercise; if the progress is steady and continuous and in the right direction, success is sure to
crown the work.</p>

<p>The second division of the book will be free-hand drawing, <i>i. e.</i>, that which is executed without instruments.
Nothing to instruct has been spared in this important step in the path of advancement.</p>

<p>The illustrations accompanying the two opening sections have been made designedly elementary, for there
are many who have a taste for drawing and who have a desire to learn, who from place of residence or other
circumstances have not the opportunity of receiving the assistance of a master. To such this book presents itself
as a friend directing to the right road, talking, reasoning, and explaining by the way.</p>

<p>The “chalk-work” and “free-hand” sections of the book relate to the foundations upon which all must rest
who seek the aid to be derived from the art; hence, the following pages are written with a view to encourage all,
and those who are prepared to follow the directions given in them may look forward to the possession of sufficient
drawing power to add to their usefulness in after life.</p>

<p>At this point of attainment there arises a need to know the meaning of many words and phrases used by
draughtsmen; these are grouped alphabetically from A to Z under the heading <span class="nowrap">of,&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Useful Terms and Definitions: Memorizing these few pages will be of benefit, as an intimate knowledge
of the language of the drawing office stamps a man as worthy of a hearing, and assures attention to anything
which he may write or say pertaining to the art.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page23">[23]</span></p>

<p>After the Definitions the subject explained will be the Instruments and Materials used in mechanical
drawings; following in due course appear Geometrical and Mechanical Drawing, Gearing, Linear Perspective, Projection,
Shading, Tracing, Lettering, Drawing Office Rules, Reading Drawings, Useful Tables and a General Index,
to which the student is referred. A careful reading is requested to the following helpful note.</p>

<p>Grateful acknowledgment is made to George Perrott, Esq., M. E., for practical and technical assistance
throughout the work, and to Theo. Lucas, Engineer, for text and illustrations in the portions of the book relating
to Linear Perspective and Projection.</p>

<div class="note">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;In <span class="smcap">Machinery</span> Prof. Chas. H. Benjamin says, referring to drawing, under heading “How and what to study,” “... I have
so far said nothing about drawing, for I do not think it of much use to learn that, until you know what you want of it. All this time that
you have been studying mechanism you should have had a sketch book or pad of note paper, and made free hand sketches of mechanical
movements which interested you and of various machine details. You should accustom yourself to use drawing as a means of expressing
ideas, just as you use written words, so that it becomes a second nature to you to sketch anything you wish to remember or describe. If
you work from blue-prints in the shop, or if you can borrow some to study, this will help you to understand how a drawing is made. You
can get some drawing instruments at any time and begin to practice on drawing straight lines and circles, so as to become familiar with
the instruments. And here it will be of great benefit to you if you can attend an evening drawing school for one night in the week
at least.</p>

<p>“When you have become sufficiently familiar with the principles of drawing, a book on mechanism will tell you how to draw gear
teeth and cams, and how to design various link motions. Make up your own problems from what you see in the shop and make your drawing
a means to an end and not the principal thing; it is of little use to be able to make a nice drawing unless you know what to draw and why.</p>

<p>“Drawing is a convenient tool as an aid in expressing to others the ideas which you wish to convey; in all cases take the problems
and the ideas from your every-day work and that which is around you; your success will depend upon the close connection which you
keep at all times between your acquired knowledge and your practical work.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Chalk Work.</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>The blackboard has been well called the great
weapon of the modern educator; this is especially true
in reference to instruction in an art dealing with lines,
curves and figures.</p>

<div class="container leftfloat w20em" id="Fig6">
<img src="images/illo027a.jpg" alt="Chalk-crayon" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 6.</p>
</div>

<p>Many a man can chalk out on a blackboard, or on
a piece of sheet-iron, or on the floor, just what he wants
to show, and make his meaning very plain; hence, in
every workshop, and many other places, a blackboard
is more than useful, and it has been said that no
draughting office is complete without one.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig6">Fig. 6</a> represents a chalk-crayon.</p>

<div class="container" id="Fig7">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page28">[28]</span></p>

<p><a href="#Fig7">Figs. 7 and 8</a> need no explanation, as they represent
two forms of the well-known blackboard.</p>

<p>Chalk lines have this advantage&mdash;they are easily
altered or rubbed out when not needed any longer.
The work executed upon a blackboard is mostly
done by hand, without aid from instruments; a few
tools, however, are useful&mdash;such as, 1, large wooden
blackboard compasses holding a crayon, which are made
and sold by the trade in size twelve inches to thirty
inches in length; 2, a straight-edge; and 3, some crayons.
With the compasses circles and part of the circle
can be made, and with the straight-edge the larger
lines can be drawn.</p>

<p>These instruments are shown on <a href="#Page29">page 29</a>, and are,
1, compasses, for holding chalk for making circles; 2, a
tee-square; 3, a straight-edge; 4, a protractor for measuring
angles; 5, a triangle 60° and 30°; 6, a brass
holder for crayons.</p>

<p>Blackboard Drawing.&mdash;The use of a blackboard
comes principally and properly under the head of<span class="pagenum" id="Page29">[29]</span>
free-hand drawing, but its importance is such that a
separate division of the volume is assigned to it.</p>

<div class="container w50em">
<img src="images/illo029.jpg" alt="Instruments" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page30">[30]</span></p>

<p>Thus, chalk-work may be considered the first lesson
in “free-hand,” as all the examples can also be most
profitably practiced with pencil and paper.</p>

<p>Very rapid drawing upon the board should not be
encouraged, as it is likely not to be accurate enough;
again, the board should be entirely free from grease.
Cloths, sponges or chamois skin rubbers may be used
to erase or change the chalk marks. Vertical lines
should be drawn from above downward; short lines
should be drawn with the fingers alone, those somewhat
longer with the hand, using the wrist-joint; the still
longer lines with the forearm, using the elbow-joint;
those longer yet with the whole arm, using the
shoulder-joint; lines should always be drawn with a
uniform motion, slow enough for the eye to follow.</p>

<p>Practice in chalk-work should alternate with
sketching in a sketchbook and with geometrical drawing&mdash;to
be hereafter described. The student should
practice a short time on the board, at least once a week;
large sizes are the most profitable for the representations
to be made; when drawing in different directions the
hand should be turned, not the paper or board; the
hand should never be allowed to obstruct the sight,
hence the hand and fingers should be held in a position
of freedom&mdash;with fingers not nearer than 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> or 2
inches from the board.</p>

<div class="note">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The first lesson of any kind the author received in
drawing was to make a straight line; this was effected by holding
the pencil nearly erect and guiding it along by the aid of the little
finger held pressed against the edge of a board; this was a useful
item of knowledge, as proved by passing years.</p>

<p>A well-known artist, in telling his early experience, said:
“The first thing I was taught was to draw a line, divide it, erect
a perpendicular from its center, and afterwards to divide the angle
made by the perpendicular.” In answer to a question asking how
long he was kept at the lines, he replied, “about two months&mdash;or
a month or two,” indicating that even the longer time would have
been well spent in learning to draw a straight line.</p>

</div><!--note-->

<h3>PREPARATORY PRACTICE IN DRAWING.</h3>

<p>Every visible object is bounded by lines which
enable the observer to determine its shape. If these<span class="pagenum" id="Page31">[31]</span>
lines are straight or curved, the shape of the object is
regular; if broken, the shape of the object is irregular.</p>

<p>The elements, then, of form are lines, straight,
curved, or broken, and these, therefore, furnish the
beginning of all instruction in free-hand or mechanical
drawing.</p>

<h3>PERPENDICULAR LINES.</h3>

<p><a href="#Fig1516">Fig. 15</a> shows six lines&mdash;upright and perpendicular,
with points or “dots” indicated at the top and bottom
of each line; to draw these, proceed thus:</p>

<div class="container w30em" id="Fig1516">

<img src="images/illo031.png" alt="Straight lines" />

<div class="split4060">

<p class="caption padl6">Fig. 16.</p>
</div>

<p class="thinline allclear">&#160;</p>

</div><!--split4060-->

</div><!--container-->

<p>The learner should stand with his right shoulder
opposite the board, and the weight of the hand and the
arm should be allowed to fall naturally; now, make on
the board two points, one being six inches above the
other, these being merely “dots,” shown at the ends of
the lines, <a href="#Fig1516">figs. 15</a>, etc., and made with two motions;
the line between the points should now be drawn
not too quickly from the upper to the lower point;
three movements of the hand and arm complete the
line; to draw the other five lines the movements have
simply to be repeated.</p>

<p>If the student pronounces to himself “one,”
“two,” “three,” at each motion, it will be helpful; in
this exercise, <a href="#Fig1516">fig. 15</a>, the aim is to make six lines, each
line being parallel to the first. Again, in the example,
it is intended that the lower point should be made
first, next the upper, and lastly the line drawn from the
upper to the lower point, but the order may be reversed;
at <i>one</i> the upper point, at <i>two</i> the lower, at
<i>three</i> the stroke upwards to complete the line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page32">[32]</span></p>

<h3>HORIZONTAL LINES.</h3>

<p>To make these as shown in <a href="#Fig1516">fig. 16</a>, proceed as
follows: With the word <i>one</i> make a point, with <i>two</i>
another point six inches at the left, with <i>three</i> draw a
straight line from the left point to the right. All added
lines should be parallel: for practice, reverse the process
thus, <i>one</i>, make a “point,” at <i>two</i> another point at the
right, at <i>three</i> draw line to the left.</p>

<p>The student will note that the two motions&mdash;at
the words <i>one</i> and <i>two</i>&mdash;are to fix the positions of the
ends of the lines; this practice will be found useful in
the most advanced examples and an item of elementary
practice never to be forgotten&mdash;like the help to be
derived by the first round of a ladder.</p>

<h3>OBLIQUE LINES.</h3>

<p>In drawing oblique straight lines as shown in <a href="#Fig1718">fig.
17</a>, at the word <i>one</i> let the student make the lower
point; at the word <i>two</i> the upper, a little to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page33">[33]</span>
right of the lower; at the word <i>three</i> draw a line
quickly from the upper to the lower point. In pronouncing
the words <i>one</i>, <i>two</i>, <i>three</i>, let the student
make the additional parallel lines.</p>

<p>As shown in <a href="#Fig1718">fig. 18</a>, at the word <i>one</i> make the lower
point; at the word <i>two</i> the upper point, a little <i>to the
left</i>; at the word <i>three</i> draw a line rapidly from the
upper to the lower point, and “timing” the process
by repeating <i>one</i>, <i>two</i>, <i>three</i>, make the additional parallel
lines.</p>

<div class="container w15em" id="Fig19">
<img src="images/illo033a.png" alt="Broken line" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 19.</p>
</div>

<h3>BROKEN LINES.</h3>

<p>A broken line is composed of two or more straight
lines at angles to each other (see <a href="#Fig19">fig. 19</a>). To draw
them begin (saying) <i>one</i>, make a point; <i>two</i> a point
below at the left; <i>three</i>, a point above at the left;
<i>four</i>, draw a line from the left hand point to the lower
point; at the word <i>five</i>, from the lower point to the
upper right hand point. For practice draw numerous
lines in the same way, keeping them parallel to each
other, as shown in <a href="#Fig2021">fig. 20</a>.</p>

<p>In example, <a href="#Fig2021">fig. 21</a>, the arrangement of the points
is changed&mdash;let the student draw at the words, as
follows: <i>One</i>, a point; <i>two</i>, a point above at the left;
<i>three</i>, a point below at the left; <i>four</i>, draw from the
point at the left to the upper point; <i>five</i>, from the
upper point to the lower right hand point; continue
to add parallel lines to complete the figure as shown.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig2224">Figs. 22</a> and <a href="#Fig2325">23</a> are given as examples to practice,
making first the points and then the connecting
lines and afterward the parallel lines to complete the
figures.</p>

<h3>CURVED LINES.</h3>

<p>To draw curved lines, as shown in <a href="#Fig2224">fig. 24</a>. At the
word <i>one</i>, point; at the word <i>two</i>, point three inches
directly above; <i>three</i>, at the same distance above again
make a point; now draw a curve as shown, joining the
middle point and the upper point; now draw the
curve as shown below it; finally complete figure
as shown.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig2325">Figs. 25</a> to <a href="#Fig2930">30</a> are to be practiced, making first the
points and then connecting them by the curves to
complete the figures.</p>

<p>When two or more students are working together,
with each having a blackboard, the counting may be
in concert&mdash;or a teacher could count for a class. In
these line examples care should be used in making
them of uniform length. There is a difference to be
noted between a crooked line and a broken line, the
latter being a straight line and the former deviating
from it.</p>

<p>Square chalk crayons are the best for hand work,
as lines of an even or uniform width can be drawn with
them.</p>

<p>A very fine effect is produced by using two thicknesses
of chalk, one being double the thickness of the
other; the heavy lines being used on the shade side of
objects will produce a good effect, giving thickness and
body to the object.</p>

<p>Round chalk crayons are used in the compasses to
draw circles, but hand lines drawn with them are not so
neat as those produced with the square-shaped chalk.</p>

<p>To obliterate or remove the construction, or false
lines made on the blackboard, a wooden handle two
inches in diameter with a cone end 3 or 4 inches long,
covered with chamois skin or soft cloth tightly wrapped
round the cone and fastened with a tack or drawing
pin, makes the best implement to erase lines not
required, the point of the cone will remove these without
destroying the lines or curves which meet them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page37">[37]</span></p>

<p>Sponges, chamois skin or cloth rubbers are used
to rub out the chalk drawings and clean the blackboard.</p>

<p>The best height for a diagram on the blackboard
is not higher than the head, nor lower than the elbow.</p>

<p>Horizontal lines should be made from the left to
the right; the body and arm being moved with the
hand, and kept in the same relative position with it,
will steady the hand.</p>

<p>Curved lines to the left should be drawn first,
enabling the eye to take in not only the curve in process
of formation but that already made.</p>

<p>Passing the crayon in the hand, over the intended
curve previous to marking it, will guide the eye and
give confidence to the hand in chalking the curve.</p>

<p>A proper distance from the blackboard is essential,
the face being about two feet away from it.</p>

<p>Draw with the whole arm extended from the
shoulder-joint, not from the elbow or wrist.</p>

<p>Like all the arts, drawing has a nomenclature of its
own, and nothing can be more helpful to the beginner
than to know the name of things relating to the art
of drawing. This is a language almost peculiar to
itself, and used daily and hourly by many thousands
of superintendents, foremen and master mechanics, as
well as by owners, designers and draughtsmen, hence
its introduction at this early stage.</p>

<i>the sides</i> and the point of meeting, the <i>vertex</i> of
the lines.</p>

<p class="level1">To make an angle apparent,
the two lines must meet in a
point, as <i>A B</i> and <i>A C</i>, which
meet in the point <i>A</i>, as shown
in <a href="#Fig33">fig. 33</a>.</p>

<p class="level1">Angles are measured by degrees.</p>

<p class="level1">A <i>Degree</i> is one of the three hundred and
sixty equal parts of the space about a point in a
plane.</p>

<p class="level1">Angles are distinguished in respect to magnitude
by the terms Right, Acute and Obtuse
Angles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page42">[42]</span></p>

<p class="level1">A <i>Right Angle</i> is that formed
by one line meeting another, so as
to make equal angles with that
other.</p>

<p class="level1">The lines forming a right angle are <i>perpendicular
to each other</i>.</p>

<p class="level1">An <i>Acute Angle</i> is less than
a right angle. See <a href="#Fig35">Fig. 35</a>.</p>

<p class="level1">An <i>Obtuse Angle</i> is greater
than a right angle. See <a href="#Fig36">Fig. 36</a>.</p>

<p class="level1">Obtuse and acute angles are also called <i>oblique
angles</i>; and lines which
are neither parallel nor
perpendicular to each other
are called <i>oblique lines</i>.</p>

<p class="level1">The <i>Vertex</i> or <i>Apex</i> of an angle is the point
in which the including lines meet.</p>

<p class="level1">An angle is commonly designated by a letter
at its vertex; but when two or more angles have
their vertices at the same point, they cannot be
thus distinguished.</p>

<p class="level1">For example,
when the three lines
<i>A B</i>, <i>A C</i>, and <i>A D</i> in
<a href="#Fig37">fig. 37</a> meet in the
common point <i>A</i>, we
designate either of the
angles formed, by
three letters, placing
that at the vertex
between those at the opposite extremities of the
including lines. Thus, we say, the angle <i>B A C</i>, etc.</p>

figure bounded by one uniformly
curved line, all of the

<p class="level1">The <i>Circumference</i> of a circle is the curved
line that bounds it.</p>

<p class="level1">The <i>Diameter</i> of a circle is a line passing
through its center, and terminating at both ends
in the circumference, as <i>A C B</i>.</p>

<p class="level1">The <i>Radius</i> of a circle is a line extending
from its center to any point in the circumference.
It is one-half of the diameter. All the diameters
of a circle are equal, as are also all the radii <i>C D</i>,
<i>C B</i> and <i>C A</i>.</p>

<p class="level1">An <i>Arc</i> of a circle is any portion of the circumference,

circle is measured by the arc intercepted by its
sides. Thus, the arc <i>A D</i> measures the angle
<i>A C D</i>, and in general, to compare different angles,
we have but to compare the arcs, included by their
sides, of the equal circles having their centers at
the vertices of the angles.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Free-Hand Drawing.</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>A free-hand drawing is executed with the unaided
hand and eye, without guiding instruments or other
artificial help. It is necessary to be known that all
drawing required cannot possibly be done by rule and
compass, but that some portions must be drawn “free-hand,”
trusting to the eye alone.</p>

<p>Hence, it is important that the student should be
able to sketch at sight from objects he may see, or to
draw roughly, with a piece of chalk or a pencil, pieces
of mechanism required to be represented.</p>

<p>Practice in free-hand should go along with mechanical
drawing as progress is made, and thus cultivating
both branches equally.</p>

<p>“A simple sketch will often,” as has been rather
roughly said, “express more than yards of talk.”</p>

<p>Even a slight sketch refreshes the memory, and in
the case of the preparation of a complete set of drawings,
with a view to the making of a thoroughly finished
mechanical drawing, the proper course to pursue is, to
make a general sketch, letter the various parts for
reference, and then prepare a series of detailed sketches,
similarly lettered, and diffuse with dimensions.</p>

<p>Everyone, whatever his specialty, feels to-day that
the ability to sketch rapidly and clearly is among the
absolute necessities for correct and prompt transactions
of business, in giving and executing orders and doing
business with persons outside his profession.</p>

<p>Mistakes and misunderstandings may be averted
by means of rough sketches taken at the time and
shown for confirmation; this also saves assistants from
getting into trouble, especially if they pin the sketch
to the order, for reference, in case of the arising of
any dispute. These are a few of the advantages of
knowing how to sketch quickly and correctly.</p>

<p>In “free-hand” any sort of pencil is better than
none, but there is a considerable advantage in having a
good serviceable article&mdash;a pencil not too soft nor too
hard, and one which will retain its point for some little
time.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig55">Fig. 55</a> shows the approved position in which the
pencil should be held while sketching. The pencil
should be held firmly between the thumb and first
finger of the right hand; press the second finger against
the pencil at the opposite side to the thumb pressure,
so that the pencil is firmly held by the contact of the
thumb and two fingers&mdash;the third and fourth fingers
just coming into easy reach of the paper surface&mdash;the
wrist or ball of the hand resting lightly on the surface
of the work&mdash;the arm resting on the desk or drawing-board
for steadiness.</p>

<p>The motion of the pencil is produced from the
movement of the fingers and thumb, principally in the
vertical strokes, and the horizontal strokes are produced
by fingers and thumb, combined with a wrist or
elbow motion; the oblique lines and curves are produced
with a free movement, with nothing cramped or
confined about the finger joints.</p>

<h3>POSITION.</h3>

<p>It should be observed that nothing is more prejudicial
to good execution than the habit of leaning over
the paper, which ought to be placed on a surface sufficiently
inclined to bring every portion equally under
the eye, thus obviating the necessity of leaning forward.
All support to the figure should be obtained by resting
on the left arm, the right being left free for work. By
attention to these rules that awkwardness of position,<span class="pagenum" id="Page57">[57]</span>
so detrimental to a good figure, will be avoided. It is
better to have the light on the left hand, as in this direction
the shadow of the pencil does not interfere with
the view of the drawing.</p>

<h3>HOW TO CUT A PENCIL.</h3>

<p>Hold the pencil firmly in the
left hand, as in the drawing,
allowing about an inch to project
beyond the fingers, and
turn it gradually as the knife
removes the wood. The knife
should be held so that the blade
alone projects beyond the
fingers, and the part of it
nearest the handle used for cutting.
The pencil should be
placed against the inside of the
thumb of the right hand, as in
the drawing (<a href="#Fig56">fig. 56</a>), and the wood removed by slight
shaving. The lead should not be cut at the same time
as the wood, but rested on the thumb and pared
gently afterwards; by attention to these directions the
pencil will be economized.</p>

<h3>HOW TO DRAW STRAIGHT LINES.</h3>

<p>Before a line is drawn, the point at which it is to
commence and the point where it is to end, should be
known; and let it be distinctly understood that <i>this
judgment of the eye</i>, and placing of points, should invariably
precede the drawing of every line.</p>

<p>The first effort should, therefore, be to produce a
line of points exactly parallel with the upper edge of
the paper, and at equal distances from each other.
Commence with point <i>A</i> and place the point <i>B</i> carefully
level with it, now place a slip of paper against
these points in the original, mark their distance apart,
and see if the same proportion has been given in your
copy; if not, make the necessary correction. Proceed
with the next point, examine it, and so on to the end of<span class="pagenum" id="Page58">[58]</span>
the line. When this is complete, examine each point
in succession, to try if it is at the same distance from
the top of the paper; when this is correct, proceed to
draw the first level line. Hold the pencil as in the
drawing, <a href="#Fig57">fig. 57</a>, keeping the elbow near the side;
join <i>A</i> to <i>B</i> by one light, steady stroke, produced by a
movement of the wrist, and add stroke upon stroke
until the line is of the required depth. Continue this
process to the end of the line of points. Now place
the point <i>D</i> at the right distance below the <i>A</i>, proceed
with the points for another line as before, and continue
the lines until the paper is covered. In producing the
stroke the pencil should not be jerked, or any stop be
made between the points, but the movement should be
even throughout, and it is much better to produce each
line by several soft strokes, as <i>the repetition of delicate
lines induces lightness of touch and freedom of hand</i>;
and it is also no small advantage that lines thus produced
are more easily removed by the India rubber,
should they require correction.</p>

<h3>TO DRAW THE FIRST OBLIQUE LINE.</h3>

<p>Prepare three rows of points down the side of the
paper, on the left hand; examine them to see that they
are at equal distances from the side and from each
other; hold the pencil as in the drawing, <a href="#Fig58">fig. 58</a>, move
the elbow a little from the side, and join the points <i>A</i>
and <i>B</i> with one light line, produced by a movement of
the fingers and thumb, repeating the strokes until the
line is of the requisite depth; proceed to join <i>B</i> to <i>C</i>,
taking care previously to bring the hand a little down
the paper, as the line from <i>A</i> to <i>C</i> is too long to be
produced from one position. When the three rows of
points are filled, make another set, examine them and
proceed as before. By these means the paper will be
covered with oblique lines, and if the points have been
placed exactly, the sheet will have a neat and regular
appearance.</p>

<p>It is a common, and at the same time highly injurious
habit, to draw this line by a movement of the
wrist, the fingers remaining rigid. This may be detected
by watching the action of the thumb; if it bends
as the line is produced, all is right; but if it does not
the wrist is at work.</p>

<h3>TO DRAW THE UPRIGHT OR PERPENDICULAR LINE.</h3>

<p>This line demands the greatest attention, and any
care bestowed upon it will be amply repaid in the after
studies.</p>

<p>Commence by placing a line of points down the
side of the paper, examine them very carefully to see
that they are all the same distance from its edge, hold
the pencil as in the drawing, <a href="#Fig59">fig. 59</a>, move the elbow
well out from the side, and join the points by a movement
of the fingers and thumb. When one line is
complete, place the points for the next, and examine
them from the edge of the paper, not from the line just
drawn. Proceed in this manner until the paper is covered.</p>

<p>There is in most cases a tendency to place the
points for this line in a slightly inclined direction, as in
writing, though in some instances the tendency is the
opposite, a thoroughly correct eye in this respect being
a rare gift: and it may be useful to suggest that the
paper be so placed that the line of points to be produced
may be exactly in front of the eye.</p>

<h3>TO DRAW THE SECOND OBLIQUE LINE.</h3>

<p>Prepare three rows of points down the side of the
paper, examine them for correctness of position, hold
the pencil as in the drawing, <a href="#Fig60">fig. 60</a>, remove the elbow
as far as possible from the side, and join the points by
a movement of the fingers and thumb, and continue the
exercise until the paper is covered.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that each change in direction

corresponding change in the position of the elbow and
wrist. The following simple rule will assist the memory
when placing the hand for any given line; the
pencil should be held so that it may form a T with the

<p>It may also be interesting to notice, with regard to
the movements by which lines are produced, that they
are divided into two systems; the first is that of the
wrist, which includes the horizontal, and lines in nearly
the same direction;
the second is that of
the fingers and
thumb, by which all
other lines are
formed. The following
diagram exhibits
the two systems and
their various lines
grouped, and it will
be observed that
there is a space marked (a) between the two sets, which
may be considered neutral ground. Lines in this
direction may be produced by either movement, as
may be most convenient, but it will always be found
that these lines are the most trying to the hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page65">[65]</span></p>

<h3>ON FIGURES FORMED OF STRAIGHT LINES.</h3>

<p>Before commencing this subject, let it be clearly
understood that future success will, in a great measure,
depend upon the amount of care bestowed upon it.
The aim should be to obtain absolute accuracy, and for
this end the copies should be tested by the most careful
measurements, and corrected until they are true
with the originals, but it should be distinctly understood
that these measurements are only to be made
after the eye and hand have done their best.</p>

<div class="note">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;To some it may appear that too much time and care
has been bestowed on mere lines, but let it be understood that a
good system of line drawing is the basis of all education&mdash;the
slightest outline by a hand thus trained has a bold, free and
masterly character; and with regard to shading, which is simply
an aggregation of good lines, it is only by such a practiced hand
its most charming effects can be produced.</p>

</div><!--note-->

<p><a href="#Fig6667">Fig. 66</a>: Place the points <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>. Examine them
to see that they are the same distance apart as in the

now place the point <i>D</i> opposite <i>C</i> and under <i>B</i>; try
the distances between each point to see that they are
the same; divide each side by a point half way, and
then draw the lines.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig6667">Fig. 67</a>: Repeat the last figure and add the

<p><a href="#Fig7071">Fig. 70</a>: The greatest care should be taken with
the squares for this and the following figure, as the
slightest error in them will destroy the symmetry of
the drawing within; when the square is completed, join
the opposite corners, and place on the crossed lines the
points <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, <i>D</i>, <i>E</i>; examine these to see that they are
each at the same distance from the centre <i>A</i>, and that
this distance is equal to the space from <i>A</i> to the sides
of the square; when all are proved to be correct, complete
the figure.</p>

<h3>ON CURVED LINES.</h3>

<div class="container rightfloat w15em">
<img src="images/illo069a.png" alt="Curves" />
</div>

<p>The right position of the hand for drawing any
curved line is that required for a straight line which
would touch the extremities of
the curve. The straight lines
given in the exercises are valuable,
not only as a guide to the
position of the hand, but as an assistance to the eye
when forming the curves or examining them after they
are produced.</p>

<p>The direction given for drawing a straight line was
to form it by one steady movement from point to point,
without any jerk or stop by the way. This instruction
requires to be changed for the curve, <i>which is better
produced by several short strokes</i>, thus:</p>

<div class="container w20em">
<img src="images/illo069b.png" alt="Curves" />
</div>

<p class="noindent">or by overlapping
lines, any outside bits
being cleared away
with India rubber.</p>

<p>These exercises will test the drawing power and
try the patience of the pupil, but they are worthy of all
the care which can be bestowed, which in future efforts
will meet with its full reward.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig7677">Fig. 76</a>: Draw first the square as directed in the
previous lesson, join the points <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i> and add the
short lines at <i>E</i> and <i>F</i>, proceed with the curve <i>A B</i>,
drawing it with faint lines at first, and adding stroke
upon stroke until the required depth is obtained; the
curve <i>A C</i> is more difficult to produce, in consequence
of the formation of the hand; it should, therefore, be
drawn in shorter pieces, joining them together afterwards
by over strokes.</p>

lines, proceed with the curves, taking care
to make each of the same proportion.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig7879">Figs. 79</a> and <a href="#Fig8081">80</a>: The ovals contained
in these figures are simply foreshortened
circles, and as such forms are of frequent
occurrence in sketching from objects, in bridges,
wheels, ends of timber, etc., they should be carefully
studied; the greatest difficulty is to turn the narrow
ends, and prevent their looking like corners. For this
purpose it is better to draw the short curves first, thus:</p>

<p class="noindent">and then join the longer sides to them.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig8081">Fig. 81</a>: If this figure can be drawn correctly, a
great success has been achieved; the circle is a most
difficult form to delineate, and without system could
not be accomplished. Draw the square and straight
lines within it with great care, examine each point of
the octagon to see that it is at the same distance from
the centre, and then draw the circle.</p>

<h3>EXAMPLES FOR PRACTICE.</h3>

<p>Several figures, <a href="#Fig83">83</a> to <a href="#Fig96">96</a>, representing more or less
familiar parts of machines, utilities, etc., are introduced
for practice in free-hand, <span class="nowrap">but&mdash;</span></p>

<p>It must be noted that even in free-hand the wise
student will occasionally use the straight edge and
compasses, so as to make his first attempts fairly creditable.
Many good draughtsmen have begun by simply
copying such figures and illustrations as are used
throughout this volume and other similar sources;
perhaps there is nothing better for practice or training
than the copying and reproducing of samples of good
mechanical drawings, yet it must always be remembered
that advancement in free-hand must be made in
the line of less to greater efforts, and that the why and
wherefore will be constantly asked by the aspiring student;
that good and correct drawings are to be aimed
for at all times in every line and dimension&mdash;never
forgetting the law of proportion in the smallest outlines
of objects to be represented.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig83">Fig. 83</a> is a section, or end view of a bar of angle
iron; the student will find helpful practice in attempting
this figure; he may be allowed to use a straight-edge
in drawing the lines, but no measurements; the
work should be tested on completion by a rule, or
better by penciling from the original on tracing paper,
and comparing the free-hand with the copy, when the
defective proportions, if any, will be clearly exhibited.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig84">Fig. 84</a> is a section of tee iron, and <a href="#Fig85">fig. 85</a> is a

<p>In the example, <a href="#Fig9495">fig. 94</a>&mdash;a hand-wheel&mdash;the principal
difficulty, even for the most advanced student

convenient, can be used to scribe about, in drawing
these; the other parts can afterwards be filled in around
the circle. <a href="#Fig96">Fig. 96</a> is introduced for practice in penciling
and shading; the figure represents a water-wheel
on a stone pier.</p>

<p>The familiar oil can is shown in <a href="#Fig9495">fig. 95</a>. These all
are excellent objects for practice.</p>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>Geometry is the science of measurement; it has
been known for more than three thousand years;
many lives have been devoted to its development, and
it exists to-day as the foundation of all mathematics.</p>

<p>Geometrical drawing is the art of representing, to
the eye, the problems “worked out” by geometricians,
and the importance of a knowledge of geometrical
drawing is paramount. The student will find that the
figures delineated and explained in the next few pages
constantly occur in mechanical drawing. Says Walter
Smith, State Director of Art Education in Massachusetts,
“I have never known a case where a student did
not progress more satisfactorily in his studies after a
course of practical geometry.”</p>

<p>The elementary conceptions of geometry are few:</p>

<div class="diagonalp">

<p>1.&mdash;A point.<br />
<span class="padl4">2.&mdash;A line.</span><br />
<span class="padl8">3.&mdash;A surface.</span><br />
<span class="padl12">4.&mdash;A solid, and</span><br />
<span class="padl16">5.&mdash;An angle.</span></p>

</div><!--diagonalp-->

<p>All of which elements are used in mechanical drawings.</p>

<p>From these, as data, a vast number of mathematical
problems have been deduced; of which a few of
the most elementary will be illustrated in this work;
but these few will repay the attention of the student.</p>

<p>In “freehand” drawing the crayon and pencil
are used; in geometrical drawings the dividers, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page82">[82]</span>
shown in illustration, <a href="#Fig97">fig. 97</a>, together with a rule, are
all that is necessary to accomplish the work.</p>

<p>A problem is something to be done, and geometry
has been defined as the science of measurement; the
relation between geometry and mechanical drawing
is very close, hence the term “geometrical problem.”</p>

</div>

<p>Before proceeding with the examples, a few
elementary statements belonging to the science of
geometry are presented; these will be useful to the
student, not only while “doing” the problems, but in
many cases of every-day&mdash;future&mdash;experience.</p>

<p>Geometry is one of the oldest and simplest of
sciences; it may be defined as <i>the science of measurement</i>;
geometry is <i>the root</i> from which all regular
mathematical calculations issue. It has claimed the
best thought of practical men from the times of the
Greeks and Romans two thousand years ago; they
derived their knowledge of the science from the Egyptians,
who in turn were indebted to the Chaldeans and
Hindoos in times beyond any authentic history;
hence it was under the operations of
the laws explained in geometry, that the pyramids
of Egypt and the temples of Greece were
constructed, as well as the engines of war and
appliances of peace of ancient times.</p>

<p><i>A point</i> is mere position, and has no magnitude.</p>

<p><i>A line</i> is that which has extension in length only.
The extremities of lines are points.</p>

<p><i>A surface</i> is that which has extension in length
and breadth only.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page83">[83]</span></p>

<div class="container leftfloat w03em">
<img src="images/illo083a.png" alt="Angle" />
</div>

<p><i>A solid</i> is that which has extension in length,
breadth and thickness.</p>

<p><i>An angle</i> is the difference in the direction
of two lines proceeding from the same
point.</p>

<p>Lines, Surfaces, Angles and Solids constitute the
different kinds of quantity called <i>geometrical</i> magnitudes.</p>

<div class="container allclear leftfloat w03em">
<img src="images/illo083b.png" alt="Lines" />
</div>

<p><i>Parallel lines</i> are lines which have the
same direction; hence parallel lines can
never meet, however far they may be produced; for
two lines taking the same direction cannot approach or
recede from each other.</p>

<p>An <i>Axiom</i> is a self-evident truth, not only too
simple to require, <i>but too simple to admit of demonstration</i>.</p>

<p>A <i>Proposition</i> is something which is either proposed
to be done, or to be demonstrated, and is either a
problem or a theorem.</p>

<p>A <i>Problem</i> is something proposed to be done.</p>

<p>A <i>Theorem</i> is something proposed to be demonstrated.</p>

<p>A <i>Hypothesis</i> is a supposition made with a view to
draw from it some consequence which establishes the
truth or falsehood of a proposition, or solves a problem.</p>

<p>A <i>Lemma</i> is something which is premised, or
demonstrated, in order to render what follows more
easy.</p>

<p>A <i>Corollary</i> is a consequent truth derived immediately
from some preceding truth or demonstration.</p>

<p>A <i>Scholium</i> is a remark or observation made upon
something going before it.</p>

<p>A <i>Postulate</i> is a problem, the solution of which is
self-evident.</p>

<p>Let it be <span class="nowrap">granted&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="dontshow">II</span>I. That a straight line can be drawn from any
one point to any other point;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page84">[84]</span></p>

<p><span class="dontshow">I</span>II. That a straight line can be produced to any
distance, or terminated at any point;</p>

<p>III. That the circumference of a circle can be
described about any center, at any distance from that
center.</p>

<p>The common algebraic signs are used in Geometry,
and it is necessary that the student in geometry should
understand some of the more simple operations of
algebra. As the terms circle, angle, triangle, hypothesis,
axiom, theorem, corollary and definition are constantly
occurring in a course of geometry, they are
abbreviated as shown in the following list:</p>

<p>Trigonometry is that portion of geometry which
has for its object the measurement of triangles. When
it treats of plane triangles, it is called <i>Plane Trigonometry</i>;
and as the engineer will continually meet
in his studies of higher mathematics <i>the terms</i> used
in plane trigonometry, it is advantageous for him
to become familiar with some of the principles and
definitions relating to this branch of mathematics.</p>

<p>The circumferences of all circles contain the same
number of degrees, but the greater the radius the
greater is the absolute measures of a degree. The
circumference of a fly wheel or the circumference of
the earth have the same number of degrees; yet the
same number of degrees in each and every circumference
is the measure of precisely the same angle.</p>

<p>The circumference of a circle is supposed to be
divided into 360 degrees or divisions, and as the total
angularity about the center is equal to four right
angles, each right angle contains 90 degrees, or 90°,
and half a right angle contains 45°. Each degree is
divided into 60 minutes, or 60′; and for the sake of still
further minuteness of measurement, each minute is
divided into 60″. In a whole circle there are, therefore,
360 × 60 × 60 = 1,296,000 seconds. The annexed diagram,

<h2 class="nobreak">Drawing Materials and Instruments.</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>Drawing tools or instruments are contrived solely
for mechanical drawing; aside from this use they are
perfectly worthless, hence the quality of these special
utensils is a matter of the first consideration to the earnest
student.</p>

<p>There are several degrees of excellence to be found
in the make-up of drawing instruments and materials;
it may be remarked with truth that “any kind are good
enough, and the best none too good,” i. e., a learner in
this delightful art should not stop at the lack of goodness
or the low grade existing in his “tools,” but
rather do the best work possible with the means at
hand.</p>

<p>However, in order that acceptable work may be
accomplished, fairly good instruments should be procured.
The advice of some one experienced in the use
and care of draughting tools should be sought before
purchasing. A drawing board, a single sheet of paper
and a pencil is the simplest “outfit” to be thought of;
to this small beginning may be added, soon afterwards,
an inexpensive pair of compasses, a T-square and a
couple of triangles; a vast range of work can be executed
with these few tools.</p>

<p>Nothing else will be needed to do fine work
except, perhaps, one or two pairs of better compasses
and a few sweeps or means of drawing irregular
curves; all these had best be purchased separately; for
in buying a “box of instruments,” it may contain some
articles which are not desired, or that are of a wrong
size, or even duplicates of those already possessed.</p>

<div class="note">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The purchasing of drawing tools is one of the most
difficult points to settle that can present itself to a person about to
buy a drawing outfit for the first time. Nothing can be so productive
of distress to a person drawing as to have his tools getting out
of order, joints one day too tight, next day too slack, points getting
blunt or perhaps turning up altogether; if needle points, then
the needles slip up, and drawing spoiled; in fact, the purchaser
can be annoyed in numberless different ways.&mdash;<span class="smcap">W. H. Thorn.</span></p>

<h3>THE DRAWING BOARD.</h3>

<p>A drawing-board should be made of well seasoned
pine of a convenient size, say 23 × 16, which will take
half a sheet of imperial paper, leaving <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>-inch margin
all around.</p>

<p>The working surface of the board&mdash;or its front
side&mdash;should be perfectly smooth, but instead of being
flat it should have a very slight camber, or rounding,
breadthways, this latter feature in its construction
being to prevent the possibility of a sheet of paper
when stretched on its surface having any vacuity
beneath it.</p>

<p>The <i>four edges</i> of the board need not form an
exact rectangle, as much valuable time is often wasted
in the attempts to produce such a board; but it will
answer every purpose of the draughtsman so long as
the adjacent edges at the lower left-hand corner of it
are at right angles, or square to each other.</p>

<p>An English authority recommends the use of two
drawing-boards, 42 inches long and 30 inches wide,
made of plain stuff, without cleets, 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inches thick&mdash;seasoned&mdash;with
edges perfectly straight and at right
angles to each other. <i>With two boards, one may be
used for sketching and drawing details and the other for
the finished drawing.</i></p>

<p>The board should be <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inch in thickness, and
fitted at the back, at right angles to its longest side,
with a couple of hardwood battens, about 2 inches wide
and <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inch thick; the use of these battens being to
keep the board from casting or winding and to allow
of its expansion or contraction through changes of
temperature. This latter purpose, however, is only
effected by attaching the battens to the back of the
board in the following manner: ... At the middle
of the length of each batten&mdash;which should be one
inch less than the width of the board&mdash;a stout, well-fitted
wood screw is firmly inserted into it, and made to
penetrate the board for about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inch, the head of the
screw being made flush with the surface of the batten;
on either side of the central screw, two others, about
3<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches apart, are passed through oblong holes in
the battens, and screwed into the body of the board
until their heads are flush with the central one; fitted
in this way the board itself can expand or contract
lengthwise or crosswise, while its surface is prevented
from warping or bending.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page108">[108]</span></p>

<div class="container" id="Fig141">
<img src="images/illo108.png" alt="Drawing board" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 141.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page109">[109]</span></p>

<p>A further improvement in such a drawing board
as above shown is made by cutting lengthwise along its
ends a narrow groove and inserting an ebony or hardwood
strip; this is cut or sawn apart at about every
inch to admit of contraction; this strip serves as a guide
to the stock of the drawing square, allowing an easy
sliding movement.</p>

<p>To produce really good work in the shape of a
mechanical drawing, one perfect straight edge only is
required on a drawing board, and that the left one,
which is always known as the <i>working-edge</i>; but for
the convenience of being able to draw a long line across
the board at right angles to its lower edge, this edge is
made truly square with that on the left side of the
board.</p>

<p>The details for building these drawing boards are
given, because they are easy to be made by one who
understands the use of a few wood-working tools; while
the boards themselves are difficult of transportation&mdash;in
case of the change of residence of their owners&mdash;quite
unlike the instruments which are to accompany
them.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig141">Fig. 141</a> represents the board which has been described
in the text, with provisions for the contraction
and expansion; the very dark lines are intended to
represent the ebony insertions&mdash;as described. <a href="#Fig140">Fig. 140</a>
represents a plain pine board with dovetailed battens.</p>

</div>

<p><a href="#Fig142">Fig. 142</a> represents the common means used to attach
or secure slightly or temporarily the drawing paper
to the drawing board; these are called thumb-tacks,
and are usually forced through the paper into the wood
by the hand, whence they are easily detached. These
are made to have as slight a projection as may be, so as
not to interfere with the free movement of the tee-square.</p>

<p>For mechanical drawing the invariable practice is
to secure the paper on which the drawing is to be made
to the drawing board by pinning it; this is effected by
various kinds of <i>drawing pins</i> or <i>thumb-tacks</i>.</p>

<p>The best kind for this purpose have a head as
thin as possible without cutting at its edges, slightly
concave on the under side next the paper, and only so
much convex on its upper side as will give it sufficient
thickness to enable the pin to be secured to it; better
use four or more small pins along the edge of a sheet
of paper, than use one clumsy, badly made pin at each
end.</p>

<p>A most convenient&mdash;and except for its extreme
lightness, which is not good in a drawing stand&mdash;a
most admirable device is shown in <a href="#Fig138">fig. 138</a>. The drawing
table is simply a drawing board with folding legs;
these are made from hard-wood, while the top is made<span class="pagenum" id="Page112">[112]</span>
of soft, seasoned pine, with square corners; while the
device is strong and well braced, it can be folded and
easily carried about&mdash;all as shown in the illustration.</p>

</div>

<h3>THE TEE-SQUARE.</h3>

<p>This is an instrument in the form of a letter T, as
shown in the <a href="#Fig149150">figures 149 and 150</a>; the two parts are
known as <i>stock</i> and <i>blade</i>; the horizontal part of the
letter (T) is the stock, and the vertical part the blade&mdash;hence
the name, T-square; to form the square,
the two parts are joined together in such a way as to
make them exactly at right angles to each other; the
stock, which is applied to the working edge of the
drawing board, being about one-third the length of the
blade, and about three times its thickness.</p>

<div class="container" id="Fig149150">
<img src="images/illo112b.jpg" alt="T-squares" />
<p class="caption">Figs. 149 and 150.</p>
</div>

<p>To be perfect in construction, a tee-square should
be as light as is consistent with its necessary strength
and stiffness of parts; it should be made of suitable
material easily manufactured, put together, and repaired,
and withal as truly correct as is possible to be
made. Such a square is represented in <a href="#Fig148">fig. 148</a>; it
has a taper blade, which is generally about double
the width where secured to the stock as it is at the
end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page113">[113]</span></p>

<div class="container leftfloat w20em"  id="Fig151152">
<img src="images/illo113.png" alt="T-square" />
<p class="caption">Figs. 151 and 152.</p>
</div>

<p>The manner in which the stock is united to the
blade determines its adaptability or otherwise to the
use made of it; in some the stock is rectangular in section,
and the blade mortised into it; in others the
blade is dovetailed and let into the stock for the whole
of its thickness.</p>

<h3>ADJUSTABLE BLADED SQUARE.</h3>

<p>In cases where many parallel lines have to be
drawn, of lengths beyond the capabilities of ordinary
set-squares, and in directions other than square with or
parallel to the working edge of the drawing board it is
convenient to have for use an <i>adjustable</i> bladed tee-square,
or one whose blade can be set at any desired
angle. The blade of such a square should be tapered
as in illustration, but shaped at its wide end as shown,
and having a stock wide enough to allow for the surface
required in the washers of the fittings necessary to
make the blade adjustable. These fittings, though requiring
to be well made and neatly finished, are not
expensive or difficult to make, as they consist merely
of two washers, a square-necked bolt, and a fly nut.</p>

<p>The tee-square, as
shown, has four parts: 1,
blade; 2, fixed head; 3,
shifting head; 4, swivel.
The head is held firmly
by the left hand to the left
edge of the drawing board,
and the blade serves as a
straight-edge for horizontal
lines that may extend
the whole length of the
paper. It can be used for
either horizontal, or, by
reversing to the bottom of
the board, for vertical
lines; and, by turning it
over, so that the shifting
head is against the edge of the drawing board instead<span class="pagenum" id="Page114">[114]</span>
of the fixed head, lines at different angles may
be drawn. The length of the blade should be the length
of the drawing board; if it is shorter, inconvenience will
be experienced when lines the whole length of the
board are wanted.</p>

<h3>TRIANGLES, OR SET-SQUARES.</h3>

<p>Set-squares are invariably used in connection with
the tee-square, as shown in <a href="#Fig148">fig. 148</a>. The illustrations
below show several patterns of the device; by these,
vertical lines, triangles, squares and hexagonal, octagonal
and twelve-sided figures, diagonal section lines,
etc., can be easily drawn. For ordinary purposes, a
triangle or set-square with angles of 45° may be 4
inches long and the other 8 inches in length, but a
six-inch set-square having angles 90°, 45° and 45°,
and an eight-inch one having angles of 90°, 60° and
30°, will be found sufficient for all purposes; there are
other triangles used specially for making letters.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 153.&mdash;Fig. 154.&mdash;Fig. 155.&mdash;Fig. 156.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>In practice the triangles or set-squares are slid
along the edge of the blade, and need not be any
thicker than it.</p>

<h3>PARALLEL RULE.</h3>

<div class="container w40em" id="Fig157">
<img src="images/illo114b.jpg" alt="Parallel rule" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 157.</p>
</div>

<p>This instrument is used to mark lines which are
neither horizontal nor vertical (usually these are drawn
by the square and set-square), and which are parallel
to one another; by adjusting the edge of the parallel
ruler to a line, it can be extended or opened out (or<span class="pagenum" id="Page115">[115]</span>
vice-versa closed), and the line or lines drawn will be
parallel or equally distant from the base or first line it
was set by. See <a href="#Fig157">fig. 157</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig158">Fig. 158</a> is a parallel ruler, constructed with two
rollers fixed on a rod so that they move the same
distance, carrying the ruler parallel to the starting line.</p>

<div class="note">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;It has been said that “a workman may be known by his tools,” but the statement must be taken with a good deal of allowance.
Some workmen may possess a very fine set of tools and never use them, because they have not the ability or inclination to learn
how; especially is this the case with drawing instruments.</p>

<p>If all the fine sets of drawing instruments that are owned by workmen were put to frequent use the owners would find a marked improvement
in their abilities in other lines as well as drawing; for it is a noticeable fact that when a person’s mind has been trained in a
business that requires close calculation and a knowledge of materials, he is capable of showing good qualifications in other lines, and the
more skilled he is in one the easier can he acquire skillfulness in another, if he applies the same amount of energy, thought and interest
as he did to acquire skill in the first.</p>

<h3>IRREGULAR CURVE OR SCROLL.</h3>

<p>Irregular curves, or, as they are sometimes termed,
sweeps, represented by <a href="#Fig160166">figs. 160-166</a>, are used for curves
that cannot be put in by the other instruments. They
are very useful when elliptical or parabolic curves are
desired, in preference to circles or arcs of a circle.
They are much used in design and architectural drawing.
They are made of thin hardwood or rubber, and
sometimes of horn.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>Curves are irregular lines; a circle is a regular line.
If a curve is to be passed through a number of predetermined
points it should be first sketched in lightly,
free-hand; a section of the scroll is then applied to the
curve so as to embrace as many points as possible;
only the central points of those thus embraced should
be inked in; this process is continued until the desired
curve is completed.</p>

<p>Curves are made of various material, pearwood,
cardboard, xylonite, hard rubber, and a strip of soft
lead is sometimes used, which may be easily adjusted
to the curve required.</p>

<p>The curves generally used in mechanical drawing
are shown on <a href="#Page117">previous page</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig208">Fig. 208</a>, <a href="#Page134">page 134</a>, is a logarithmic <i>spiral</i> curve.
It is mathematically constructed and contains every
curve within the limit of its size.</p>

<h3>ELLIPSES.</h3>

<p>An ellipse is a geometrical figure, and can be
drawn as described in <a href="#Ref2">geometrical problem 29</a>, <a href="#Page96">page
96</a>; many drawing offices keep sets of hard rubber
ellipses, to economize time constructing them.</p>

<h3>DRAWING PENCILS.</h3>

<p>These are instruments for marking, drawing or
writing, formed of graphite, colored chalk or materials
of similar properties, and having a tapering end,
inclosed, generally, in a cylinder of
softwood. <a href="#Fig167168">Fig. 167</a> represents a
ruling pencil; its point is a parallelogram
or of a wedge shape. In
ruling, the length view rests against
the square; its shape gives considerable
strength to the lead and
allows the making of a very fine
line. <a href="#Fig167168">Fig. 168</a> differs in the point
of the pencil shown, as may be
observed in the illustration.</p>

<p>A pencil that is hard is best
for mechanical drawing; one that
will retain a good point for some<span class="pagenum" id="Page119">[119]</span>
considerable time. Pencil lines
should be made as light as possible;
the presence of lead on the surface
of the paper tends to prevent
the ink passing to the paper, and
in rubbing out pencil lines the ink
is reduced in blackness, and the
surface of paper is roughened,
which is a disadvantage. As little
erasing or rubbing out as possible
should be done.</p>

<h3>DIVIDERS AND COMPASSES.</h3>

<p>These instruments, while they
appear alike, have a separate use:
the dividers are used to space off
distances and dimensions; especially
are they necessary in reading
drawings made to scale. <i>Compasses</i>
are used for describing circles, curves, etc., <i>dividers</i>
are used for marking out spaces.</p>

<p>Two forms of the dividers are shown in <a href="#Fig169170">figs. 169
and 170</a>; the simplest, plainest form is shown in <a href="#Fig169170">fig.
169</a>; these are used for rough spacings; <a href="#Fig169170">fig. 170</a> represents
a pair of dividers fitted with an adjustable screw
controlled by a steel spring in one leg; by this a very
exact measurement can be made. <a href="#Fig169170">Fig. 170</a> is intended
to exhibit what is called a “hair-spring divider.”</p>

<h3>PROPORTIONAL DIVIDERS.</h3>

<p>These dividers differ from the ordinary ones
shown in <a href="#Fig169170">figs. 169 and 170</a> in that they are provided
with four steel points, one pair of which being set to
the full dimension will be reproduced by the other
pair, but in a smaller, or reduced size.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig171174">Fig. 171</a> are “bisecting” dividers, being proportional
dividers, which, when open, one end measures
double the distance of the other.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig171174">Fig. 172</a> are proportional dividers; the points at
one end are capable of being changed,
to measure practically any desired
proportion at the other end, by
altering the position of the pivot
where the legs cross one another.
The lower connecting link is a
micrometer adjustment, for minute
measurements.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig171174">Fig. 173</a> are proportional dividers
which are marked for the proportions
of lines and radii of circles, being
provided with a rack movement for
adjustment.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig171174">Fig. 174</a> represents three-leg dividers,
used for taking the position of
three points; this instrument is very
useful in finding the position of a point in a
figure.</p>

<h3>COMPASSES.</h3>

<p>Compasses consist of two
pointed legs; they are instruments
for describing circles or for&mdash;sometimes&mdash;measuring
figures, in
absence of dividers. <a href="#Fig175179">Fig. 175</a>
represents compasses fitted as
dividers.</p>

<p>Compasses should have jointed
legs, which will allow the points
to be placed at right angles to the
paper, whatever the size of the
circle to be drawn. Compasses
should not be used for circles
which are too large to allow the points to be thus
placed; a lengthening bar is generally provided, which
greatly increases the diameters of circles which may be
drawn by this attachment; it is shown in <a href="#Fig175179">fig. 176</a>.</p>

<p>One leg of the compasses is usually provided with
a socket to which are fitted three points: a divider
point, <a href="#Fig175179">fig. 179</a>; a pencil point, <a href="#Fig175179">fig. 177</a>;
and a point,<span class="pagenum" id="Page122">[122]</span>
<a href="#Fig175179">fig. 178</a>, carrying a special pen for the inking of circles.
Each of these points is generally provided with a joint,
so that it may be placed at right angles to the paper.</p>

<p>The other leg should be jointed; it is often provided
with a socket which receives
two points, one a divider point, and
the other carrying a needle point.
Such an instrument may be used as
dividers for spacing, or as compasses
for penciling or inking circles.</p>

<p>The joint at the head of the
compasses (see <a href="#Fig175179">fig. 175</a>) is the most
important feature. It should hold the
legs firmly in any position, so that in
going over a circle several times only
one line will result. It should allow
the legs to move smoothly and evenly,
and should be capable of adjustment.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 180.&mdash;Fig. 181.&mdash;Fig. 182.&mdash;Fig. 183.&mdash;Fig. 184.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>As shown in <a href="#Fig171174">fig. 174</a>, one leg has
a hinge or joint, and a needle point,<span class="pagenum" id="Page123">[123]</span>
which can be regulated by a thumb screw; the other
leg has a socket or recess into which interchangeable
parts can be inserted. The four figures to the right of
the compasses show the parts which are provided with
shanks or insertion pieces. <a href="#Fig180184">Fig. 180</a> and <a href="#Fig180184">fig. 181</a> represent
compasses specially used for making small circles,
and work too minute for the larger instruments described
above.</p>

<p>To do work of this nature easily a pair of spring
dividers are frequently used. This instrument has one
point attached to a spring, which is regulated by a
screw, so that very slight changes in the space may be
made with ease.</p>

<p>Compasses specially used for putting in fine circles
and dimensions are called “bows.” When a pen point
it is a “bow pen,” with a pencil point a “bow pencil,”
and if with needle point a “bow dividers.” <a href="#Fig180184">Fig. 180</a>
is a “bow dividers”, this fitted with screw for fine adjustment
in one leg, <a href="#Fig180184">fig. 181</a>, is called a “hair-spring
bow dividers”; for small details, bows with steel spring
legs without any joint are used; these are called “steel-spring
bows.”</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page124">[124]</span></p>

<h3>SPRING BOWS.</h3>

<p>These were originally developed from the common
form of compasses, with a single spring leg; later, the
demand for smaller sizes made changes necessary, and
spring bows are now made symmetrical, both sides of
the bow being made to “spring.”</p>

<p><a href="#Fig180184">Fig. 182</a> are spring dividers.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig180184">Fig. 183</a> is a spring pencil.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig180184">Fig. 184</a> is a spring pen.</p>

<p>In these figures it will be seen that the two
threads, a right and a left, are moved with one central
thumbscrew; in the <a href="#Fig185187">figs. 185 to 187</a> a single screw is
used.</p>

<p>In choosing spring bows, care must be exercised
to select a sufficiently strong, stiff spring, as the relation
between spring pressure and thumbscrew is important.</p>

<h3>BEAM COMPASSES AND TRAMMELS.</h3>

<p>In <a href="#Fig188">fig. 188</a> is shown a set of beam compasses,
together with a portion of the wooden rod or beam
on which they are used.</p>

<div class="container" id="Fig188">
<img src="images/illo124.jpg" alt="Bem compasses" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 188.</p>
</div>

<p>The latter, as will be seen by the section drawn
to one side, <i>A</i>, is in the shape of a T. This form has
considerable strength and rigidity. Beam compasses
are provided with extra points for pencil or ink work,
as shown.</p>

<p>While the general adjustment is effected by means
of the clamp against the wood, minute variations are
made by the screw, <i>B</i>, shifting one of the points, as
shown in the <a href="#Fig188">figure</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page125">[125]</span></p>

<p>This instrument is quite delicate, and, when in
good order, is very accurate. It should be used only
for fine work on paper, and never for scribing on
metal.</p>

<div class="container leftfloat w20em" id="Fig189">
<img src="images/illo125.jpg" alt="Trammel" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 189.</p>
</div>

<p>A coarser instrument, and one especially designed
for use upon metal, is shown in <a href="#Fig189">fig. 189</a>, and is called a
trammel. There are various forms of this instrument,
all being the same in principle. The engraving shows
a form in common use. A heavier stick is used with
it than with the beam compasses, and no other adjustment
is provided than that which is afforded by clamping
against the stick.</p>

<p>In the <a href="#Fig189">illustration</a>, a carrier at the side is shown,
in which a pencil may be placed. Some trammels are
arranged in such a manner, that either of the points
may be detached and a pencil substituted.</p>

<p>A trammel, by careful arrangement, can be made
to describe very accurate curves, and hence can be
used in place of the beam compasses in many instances.
For all coarse work it is to be preferred to beam compasses.<span class="pagenum" id="Page126">[126]</span>
It is useful for all short sweeps upon sheets of
metal, but for curves of a very long radius a strip of
sheet iron or a piece of wire will be found of a more
practical service than even this tool.</p>

<p>The length of rods for both beam compasses and
tramels, up to certain limits, is determined by the
nature of the work to be done. The extreme length
is determined by the strength and rigidity of the rod
itself. It is usually convenient to have two rods for
each instrument, one about 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> or 2 feet in length and
the other considerably longer&mdash;as long as the strength
of the material will admit.</p>

<h3>DRAWING SCALES.</h3>

<p>Scales are proportioned rules or mathematical instruments
of wood, metal, etc., on which are marked
lines and figures for the purpose of measuring sizes and
distances. It is usual to make scales in the proportion
of parts of an inch equalling a foot; the most generally
adopted scale for machine drawing is one and a half
inches, equalling one foot; that is, twelve-eighths of an
inch (each eighth of an inch representing one inch);
there is no fixed rule in the choice of a scale, as they
are varied according to the coarseness or fineness of the
parts of the machine to be drawn and the space or surface
of paper to be utilized.</p>

<p>When objects are of moderate proportions they
may be represented full size; but when large, the
drawings must be smaller. Standard scales for mechanical
drawings are <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>,
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> and <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> full size. These
scales are often written 6″ = 1 ft.; 3″ = 1 ft.; 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>″ = 1 ft.,
and <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>″ = 1 ft.</p>

<div class="container leftfloat w07em" id="Fig190">
<img src="images/illo127a.jpg" alt="Scale" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 190.</p>
</div>

<div class="container rightfloat w07em" id="Fig191">
<img src="images/illo127b.jpg" alt="Scale" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 191.</p>
</div>

<p>Instead of selecting one of the scales named or one
found upon the ordinary scales used by draughtsmen,
drawings may be made to any scale whatever. Thus,
if any object is to be represented in a certain space, a
scale should be constructed which will cause the whole
of the object to be shown.</p>

<p>Drawing to Scale.&mdash;The meaning of this is, that
the drawing when done bears a definite proportion to<span class="pagenum" id="Page127">[127]</span>
the full size of the particular part, or, in other words,
is precisely the same as it would appear if viewed
through a diminishing glass.</p>

<p>The two-foot rule shown in <a href="#Fig192">fig. 192</a> is the most
useful instrument for the comparison of linear dimensions&mdash;it
can be used as a scale of one-twelfth, or 1
inch equal to a foot, 12 inches = 12 feet, it being divided
into portions or spaces, each of which is subdivided
into halves, quarters, eighths and sixteenths;
frequently in the latter class of two-foot rules there are
graduations of scales, and it is then also called a
draughting scale.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig190">Fig. 190</a> represents a flat scale, graded so that one
inch represents a foot&mdash;<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>12</sub>th size&mdash;etc., as shown.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig191">Fig. 191</a> represents a triangular scale (broken).
The triangular scale should read on its different edges
as follows: Three inches and 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>″ to one foot, 1″ and
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>″ to one foot, <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>″
and <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>″ to one foot, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>″ and <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>″ to one
foot, <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub>″ and <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>32</sub>″ to one foot, and one edge read sixteenths
the whole 12″ of its length.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page128">[128]</span></p>

<p><a href="#Fig190">Fig. 190</a> shows such a scale broken. An explanation
of the 1″ and <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>″ side will suffice for all. Where
it is used as a scale of 1″ to one foot, each large space,
as from 0 to 12 or 0 to 1, represents a foot, and is a
foot at that scale. There being 12″ in one foot, the
twelve long divisions at the left represent inches; each
inch is divided into two equal parts, so from 0 to one
division at the left of 9 is 9<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>″ and so on. The 1″ and
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>″ scales being at opposite ends of the same edge, it
is obvious that one foot on the 1″ scale is equal to two
feet on the <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>″ scale, and conversely, one foot on the <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>″
scale is equal to six inches on the 1″ scale; and 1″
being equal to one foot, the total feet in length of scale
will be 12; at <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>″ to 1 foot the total feet will be 24.</p>

<p>In working to regular scales, such as <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>,
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>, or <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub>
size, a good plan is to use a common rule, instead of a
graduated scale. There is nothing more convenient for
a mechanical draughtsman than to be able to readily
resolve dimensions into various scales, and the use of a
common rule for fractional scales trains the mind, so
that computations come naturally, and after a time
almost without effort.</p>

<p>The protractor shown in <a href="#Fig193">fig. 193</a> is an instrument
for laying down and measuring angles on paper; it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page129">[129]</span>
used in connecting with a scale to define the inclination
of one line to another.</p>

<p>Protractors have the degrees of a half circle
marked upon them; as the whole circle contains 360
degrees, half of it will contain 180, one-quarter 90, etc.
Hence, protractors showing 180° exhibit all that is
needed. To protract means to extend, so this instrument
is also useful in “extending” the lines of inclination
at the circle.</p>

<h3>DRAWING-PENS.</h3>

<p>A special pen called a drawing-pen, and also special
ink, are required to ink a drawing; <a href="#Fig194">figs. 194</a> and <a href="#Fig195">195</a> represent
two sizes of drawing-pens&mdash;one being best adapted
for fine work, and the other for coarse or heavy line
work. The points, as will be observed in the illustration,
are made of two steel blades which open and close
as required for thickness of lines by a regulating screw.</p>

<div class="container" id="Fig194">
<img src="images/illo129a.jpg" alt="Pen" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 194.</p>
</div>

<div class="container" id="Fig195">
<img src="images/illo129b.jpg" alt="Pen" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 195.</p>
</div>

<p>A good drawing pen should be made of properly
tempered steel, neither too soft nor hardened to brittleness.
The nibs should be accurately set, both of
the same length, and both equally firm when in contact
with the drawing paper. The points should be so
shaped that they are fine enough to admit of absolute
control of the contact of the pen in starting and ending
lines, but otherwise as broad and rounded as possible,
in order to hold a convenient quantity of ink without
dropping it. The lower (under) blade should be sufficiently
firm to prevent the closing of the blades of the
pen, when using the pen against a straightedge.</p>

<div class="container w30em" id="Fig196">

<div class="container w15em" id="Fig197">
<img src="images/illo130b.jpg" alt="Ink bottle" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 197.</p>
</div>

<p>The spring of the pen, which separates the two
blades, should be strong enough to hold the upper<span class="pagenum" id="Page130">[130]</span>
blade in its position, but not so strong that it would
interfere with easy adjustment by the thumbscrew.
The thread of the thumbscrew must be deeply and
evenly cut so as not to strip.</p>

<p>An important requisite after the pencil lines have
been put in is ink, with which to line the drawing.
This should be of the best that can be procured. The
pen is filled by dropping the ink between the blades, or
nibs, while held in a nearly vertical position, as shown
in <a href="#Fig196">fig. 196</a>.</p>

<p>Liquid India ink can be procured in bottles with
glass tube feeders, which are very good, and keep the
hands and fingers free of
the ink. <a href="#Fig197">Fig. 197</a> is a sectional
view of such a bottle
and “filler,” or feeder. This
generally answers all requirements,
but the dry ink
of good quality, in sticks or
bars, cannot be surpassed,
although it requires skill for
its preparation. <a href="#Fig198">Fig. 198</a>
represents a sloping dish or
“tile” for mixing, which
should be done with little
pressure, in clean, filtered or
distilled water, care being taken to keep the liquid free
of dust, which obstructs the free flow of the ink in
the pens.</p>

<p>The bars of India ink are shown, as they are imported,
in <a href="#Fig199202">figs. 199 to 202</a>.</p>

<p>Pure India or China ink is only made in those<span class="pagenum" id="Page131">[131]</span>
countries, because the special wood from which it is
prepared is found only in those regions. So-called
India inks, made of lampblack and animal glue, are
only imitations; therefore India ink should be purchased
from a reliable importing house&mdash;shape is little
guarantee of quality.</p>

<p>Soft gray vulcanized rubber (<a href="#Fig203">fig. 203</a>) should be

<p>An ink eraser is made of a composition of rubber
and ground glass, and it should be used as sparingly as
possible on drawings, as it roughens the paper and removes
the gloss from its surface (see <a href="#Fig204205">fig. 204</a>). Steel
ink erasers are useful in removing defects, overrun
lines, joint of lines if swollen, etc.; they have a fine
point and can be used to advantage with a little practice;
they are used with a scratching, not a cutting,
motion (see <a href="#Fig206207">figs. 206, 207</a>).</p>

<h3>DRAWING PAPER.</h3>

<p>The first thing to be considered in selecting drawing
paper is the kind most suitable for the proposed
plan. Paper may be purchased in sheets 22 × 30
inches, that make four exercise sheets 11 × 15 inches;
this may be of several grades and tints.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page133">[133]</span></p>

<p>The qualities that constitute good paper are
strength, uniformity of thickness and surface, neither
repelling nor absorbing liquids, admitting of considerable
erasing without destroying the surface, not becoming
brittle nor discolored by reasonable exposure or age,
and not buckling when stretched, or when ink or color
is applied.</p>

<p>The sizes and names of paper made in sheets is
as follows:</p>

<table class="paper" summary="Paper sizes">

<tr>
<td class="size">Cap</td>
<td class="inches">13×17</td>
<td class="ditto">ins.</td>

<td class="size">Antiquarian</td>
<td class="inches">30×53</td>
<td class="ditto">„</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>For large drawings paper is made in rolls. “Detail
paper” is especially made for marking out new
designs; it is made in rolls 36, 42 and 54 inches wide;
it has excellent erasing qualities and takes ink and
color with facility.</p>

<p>When working by artificial light it is desirable that
the paper be of a light-brown color, which is less trying
to the eyes than a pure white.</p>

<p>If it is a shop drawing or sketch not to be preserved,
use detail paper, which is the most economical
and will stand a great deal of handling without becoming
soiled. If it is a detailed plan, finished drawing
or a picture, use the best white drawing paper to be
obtained, so that your drawings can be preserved
indefinitely without danger of fading, which is due
either to the paper being poorly made and discoloring
with age, or being of poor fiber and absorbing the ink
or color, and the drawing consequently losing its
brightness.</p>

<p>After deciding on the size of paper most suitable
for the work, then carefully select the paper
embracing the most qualities of value for the proposed
drawing.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Mechanical Drawing.</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>In distinction to “free-hand,” mechanical drawing
is executed almost entirely by the use of the instruments
previously described; hence its other term,
instrumental drawing. To define it particularly it may
be said <span class="nowrap">that,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mechanical drawing is the correct reproduction of
any figure or part of a machine, whether of full size or
reduced in the proportion of one part to another; it
also comprises the art of delineating the interior parts
which are hidden from view in solid bodies.</p>

<p>A mechanical drawing is the vehicle for conveying
the ideas of the designer to those who are to embody
them in wood and metal, and the considerations which
should govern its production are those which affect its
clearness and legibility or those which facilitate reference
to it.</p>

<p>Drawings consist of plans, elevations and sections;
plans being views on the top of the object in a
horizontal plane; elevations, views on the sides of the
object in vertical planes; and sections, views taken on
bisecting planes, at any angle through an object.</p>

<p>Drawings in true elevation or in section are based
upon flat planes, and given dimensions parallel to the
planes in which the views are taken.</p>

<p>Two elevations taken at right angles to each other
fix all points, and give all dimensions of parts that have
their axis parallel to the planes on which the views are
taken; but when a machine is complex, or when several
parts lie in the same plane, three and sometimes four
views are required to display all the parts in a comprehensive
manner.</p>

<p>A man must have either a natural talent for hand-drawing<span class="pagenum" id="Page138">[138]</span>
or years of experience, before he can produce
a sketch and “dimension” it, fit to work from; hence
the elementary character of the examples given for
practice. A “pretty” drawing is not expected from
a beginner; it should always be borne in mind, that
correctness of dimensions and general clearness, rather
than elaborate finish, are what will save the battle in
the days of competition.</p>

<p>Mechanical drawings should be made with reference
to all the processes that are required in the construction
of the work, and the drawings should be
responsible, not only for dimensions, but for adaptation
to fitting, forging, pattern-making, moulding, and so on.</p>

<p>Every part laid down should have something to
govern it that may be termed a “base”&mdash;some position
which, if understood, will suggest size, shape and relation
to other parts. Searching after a base for each
and every part and detail, the draughtsman should proceed
upon a regular system, continually maintaining a
test of what is done.</p>

<p>A mechanical drawing consists chiefly of three
views:</p>

<div class="diagonalp">
<p>1. The plan or top view.<br />
<span class="padl4">2. The side elevation.</span><br />
<span class="padl8">3. The end elevation.</span></p>
</div>

<p>In addition to the above, drawings are used to
show interior portions of the figure; these are termed
“sections,” and they may be taken where any plane
crosses another.</p>

<div class="note">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The word <i>elevation</i>, as applied to mechanical drawings,
means simply a view; hence a side elevation is a side view,
or an end elevation is an end view.</p>

<p>The word <i>plan</i> is employed in place of the word top; hence
a plan view is a top view or a view looking down upon the top of
the piece.</p>

<p>A <i>general</i> view means a view showing the machine put together
or assembled, while a detail drawing is one containing a
detail, as a part of the machine or a single piece disconnected
from the other parts of the whole machine.</p>

<p>It is very nearly true, as has been said, that every mechanical drawing is, in the first instance,
penciled; if this is so, then more work is done with the pencil than with the pen; therefore the
first attention of the student of mechanical drawing should be directed to the following instructions
for penciling a drawing.</p>

<p>With all necessary materials in hand, and in good order for the beginning of a drawing, the
first thing to do is to pin the paper on the board quite square.</p>

<p>To do this effectively, lay the paper flat and put on the T-square with its head at the left
side of the board; slide the square up nearly to the top, and arrange the paper level with the
blade; with the right hand hold the paper still and move the square down a little; now, pin the
top of the paper with thumb-tacks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page140">[140]</span></p>

<p>Next, pressing the square lightly to the paper,
slide it down to the bottom and pin that part of the
paper to the board. The paper must not project outside
or over the edges of the board, and the pins or
tack-heads should be forced down flush with the paper,
so as not to interfere with the free movement of the
tee-square up and down the board as occasion may
require.</p>

<p>The accuracy of the work depending upon their
condition, it is first needful to see that the pencil and
pencil compasses are properly sharpened. Reference
is made to valuable directions contained on pages beginning
with 55, under the heading of “Free-hand
Drawing,” to which may be added <span class="nowrap">that&mdash;</span></p>

<p>All lines should be drawn with the pencil slightly
inclined in the direction in which it is moved.</p>

<p>Any and all lines not needed in the finished drawing
should be erased at one time after the final lines
have been determined, for the surface of the paper is
soiled very quickly when worked upon after erasures
have been made.</p>

<p>The working lines and other lines that are to be
removed should be erased when the drawing is ready
to finish and before its outlines have been strengthened,
in order that the final lines may be left in perfect
condition.</p>

<p>To show where the lines meet or terminate it is
needful that all pencil lines pass the actual ending
place, making a distinct intersection. This does not
apply to “inking in” the lines, but rather to prevent
the over-drawing of the ink lines, because the edge of
the rule and the pen itself obstruct or partly cover the
view of the line, it is very liable to pass over or beyond
the required point in inking the lines, which must
not occur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page141">[141]</span></p>

<p>In the preliminary operation of producing a regular
mechanical or instrumental drawing, it is necessary
to make a “sketch,” in pencil, of the object to be
represented. The <span class="smcap">American Machinist</span> has given in
a few words the order to be followed, in effecting the
best results; we quote, as follows:</p>

<p>“In making a free-hand sketch of an object from
the model it is well to observe the following order:
Look the model over carefully and determine the
number of views necessary to illustrate it fully, drawing
the same, free-hand, in their proper relation to each
other, on sketching paper. Look the sketch over
carefully to see that nothing has been omitted, and put
on dimension lines, after which scale the model carefully
and put on dimensions. Do not put in the
dimensions at the same time the dimension lines are
drawn; have all the dimension lines in place before
attempting to insert dimensions.</p>

<p>“Follow the same order in making the drawing
with instruments as was used in making the sketch;
that is, draw the views in their proper relation to each
other, put in dimension lines, then dimensions, and
lastly notes and title. If section drawing is made, do
not draw section lines in pencil.”</p>

<h3>POINTS TO BE OBSERVED IN SKETCHING.</h3>

<p>1. Especial attention is to be paid to outlines&mdash;edges
of plane surfaces are lines; when a line is made
it represents the edge or outside of something.</p>

<p>2. Learn to be accurate before being rapid.</p>

<p>3. A sketch should be intelligible to any one,
even if they are unacquainted with drawing.</p>

<p>4. Horizontal and vertical lines and a few curves
will enable one to make almost any simple sketch.</p>

<p>5. It must be also remembered in making drawings
from actual measurement that the instruments are
not in the first place employed; the rough sketch is
first made and then it is converted into a drawing.
The draughtsman makes a rough sketch entirely by
the hand and eye, measures the various parts, and jots<span class="pagenum" id="Page142">[142]</span>
down the measurements in his sketch; after this he
reduces the whole to the desired scale, and proceeds to
make his mechanical drawing.</p>

<p>6. Let the sketch book be the constant companion
of the student; it may be advantageously
filled with outlines of machine or other work suitable
for preservation, to be made into finished drawings, or
for reference. Sketches are often valuable for reference
as aids in originating new designs.</p>

<p>7. A sketch, when possible, should have all the
dimensions written upon it, <span class="nowrap">but&mdash;</span></p>

<p>8. Sketches in shop practice should not take the
place of working-drawings; the latter have a check
upon them in being drawn to a scale&mdash;hence the
figures written upon them and dimensions by scale
must agree.</p>

<p>9. Place title and date on each sketch&mdash;no matter
how seemingly unimportant&mdash;for future reference.</p>

<p>10. Practice sketching at every favorable opportunity.
There is no necessity for detail at first&mdash;simply
the outlines of the article and its parts.</p>

<p>11. Sketch-books, with paper bound in cloth
covers, are utilized for bold, off-hand sketches by
experienced draughtsmen, but a single sheet of paper,
used on both sides, is not unworthy of service in an
emergency&mdash;or even the blank side of a letter may be
available. Sketching-blocks, or paper “pads,” 4 × 6, or
more, in size, and containing 48 sheets, are sold by
stationers, and are found to be most convenient to
have in hand and for practical use. Portfolio-envelopes,
made of extra length paper (manila) are
useful in filing away sketches and drawings. The size
10<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> × 15 is used for United States Patent Office
drawings.</p>

<p>The function of the pencil&mdash;in mechanical drawing&mdash;is
to make a path for the pen to follow. If it were
possible to make a drawing with all its lines ending at
the proper place, at the first time, there would be no
necessity for using the pencil. One is obliged, however,
so to use the pencil that all lines pass beyond the
actual ending place, thus making a distinct point for
the drawing pen to stop at.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page143">[143]</span></p>

<p>The pencil should be pressed to the paper just
enough to make a clean, fine line, and no more; once
over the path is sufficient, if the line is visible and true.</p>

<p>To sharpen drawing pencils, 1, use a fine file, after
taking off enough of the wood with a knife; 2, make a
conical point for the free-hand drawing pencils and a
chisel point for ruling and marking distances.</p>

<p>Pencil compasses are instruments where one leg is
provided with a pencil point. <a href="#Fig209">Fig. 209</a> shows the mode
of manipulation of those shown in <a href="#Fig180184">fig. 180</a> and <a href="#Fig180184">fig. 181</a>.</p>

<p>The pencil compass is held by the projection
above the joint between the thumb and first finger,
which enables it to be rotated by a movement of the
finger without causing any undue pressure on the points.
Should much pressure be applied, there is a tendency
to force the point or center through the paper, making
an ugly center mark; at the same time the pressure
tends to break off the pencil point.</p>

<p>These few illustrations from <a href="#Fig212">fig. 212</a> to <a href="#Fig216219">fig. 219</a> are

<p>The designing and drawing of arcs and whole circles
occupy a large proportion of space in nearly all
mechanical drawings. The making of a complete circle
is a matter of no great difficulty, but the beginning
and termination of parts of circles require both judgment
and considerable practice.</p>

<p>To aid the student these two illustrations of circles
are introduced. To draw <a href="#Fig220">fig. 220</a> with a pencil,
using the upper edge of the blade of the T-square
as a guide, draw a center line, <i>A B</i>, mark on it a distance
of 4 inches, space this into half inches, using the
dividers and making the points with it; then with the
pencil compasses or bow pencil, which must be held as
shown on page 209, and rotated from left to right, or
clockwise, draw a series of circles through these points,
tangent to one another or all touching at <i>A</i>, care being
taken that the pencil lines exactly meet at <i>A</i>, and
also cut the divided points as shown in the illustration.
For <a href="#Fig221">fig. 221</a> divide the center line as before, and draw
the semi-circles on it <i>A B</i>, <i>B C</i>, meeting at <i>B</i>, and
<i>C D</i>, <i>D E</i>, etc.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 221.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page147">[147]</span></p>

<p>Now from center <i>B</i> draw circles <i>A C</i>, <i>C E</i>, meeting
in <i>C</i>, and so on with the circles, arcs or segments;
success in drawing this figure depends on the correct
spacing of the center line in the first instance into
equal parts.</p>

<p>The T-square should be used for drawing horizontal
lines only. Its head should always be placed upon
the left edge of the board. Vertical lines should be
drawn by the use of a triangle placed upon the T-square
and not by means of the T-square only; because
the edges of a board are seldom at right angles to each
other, and the blade of the T-square is often not at
right angles to the head, so that lines at right angles to
each other will not result from the use of the T-square
upon all edges of the board. Only the upper edge of
the T-square should be used, as the edges are often not
quite straight or parallel.</p>

<p>The 45° triangle has two angles of 45° and one of
90°. The 30° and 60° triangle has an angle of 30°, one
of 60°, and one of 90°. By placing these triangles upon
the T-square, lines at any of these angles with a vertical
or horizontal line may be drawn.</p>

<p>Drawings finished in ink are much more effective
and desirable than pencil drawings; but as a good inked
drawing cannot be made except upon an accurate pencil
drawing, students should begin with the pencil, and
should not use ink until they are able to produce satisfactory
results in pencil.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Projection.</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>The word projection means to throw forward, and in ordinary machine drawing it is the projecting or
throwing forward of one view from another view.</p>

<p>In drawings the lines in one view or plan may be availed of to find those of others of the same object,
and also to find their shape or curvature as they would appear in the other representations; this is called
projection-drawing.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig222">Fig. 222</a> is the illustration as shown in <a href="#Fig212">fig. 212</a> on
page 143, with the addition of dotted projection line,
which illustrates the method of throwing forward the
section and the end view of the object; these two
views are procured from the plan or first figure, as
shown in <a href="#Fig222">fig. 222</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig224">Fig. 224</a> represents the square bolt and nut shown
in <a href="#Fig216219">fig. 216</a>, and the mode of projecting is similarly
shown by dotted lines.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig223">Fig. 223</a> shows file handle shown in <a href="#Fig215">fig. 215</a> and
the mode of projecting.</p>

</div>

<p>The principles upon which “projection” in drawing
is based, are illustrated in the following examples<span class="pagenum" id="Page149">[149]</span>
and text: As a real object can be scaled with a foot
rule, so a drawing must permit of scaling and measuring.
This measuring may take place as with the real
object in full size or the drawing may, for the sake of
convenience, be reproduced and measured in a reduced
scale, as half, or in still smaller sizes. Sometimes it<span class="pagenum" id="Page150">[150]</span>
may prove convenient to enlarge the drawing to twice
the natural size of the object, as a means of making it
stand out more clearly than the real size would
accomplish.</p>

<p>For practical purposes, it is productive of economy
of time to mark the dimensions of height and width
or depth on the drawing in figures, to avoid the scaling.
This marking of the dimensions is best done at the
time of making the drawing, while the conception of
the object is clear.</p>

<p>To convey a correct impression of the object, all
lines that are marked to be of equal length should appear
equally long on the drawing and be capable of being
scaled to such equal length; for this, it must be assumed
that the eye of the observer is equally distant
from all points of a plane through the nearest point, or
one of the axes of the object, and that the lines
of sight are all parallel to each other and square to
this plane.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig225">fig. 225</a> these lines of sight are seen as directed
toward one side of a cube or block; it will be readily
understood, however, that in this way nothing is visible
and accessible for scaling and dimensioning except
this front face of the block, thus, a determination of
the dimensions of only height and width would be possible,
while the dimension of depth is entirely undetermined.</p>

<div class="container w30em" id="Fig225">
<img src="images/illo151.png" alt="Sight lines" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 225.</p>
</div>

<p>It is thus necessary to get a view of the block from
another side; the direction in which it will be most
instructive to obtain additional views is in the direction
of the breadth and of the length and square to the
lines of sight of the first view.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig226">Fig. 226</a> shows how the lines of sight would strike
the object in the three directions. If these lines should
be rays of light, some of them would pass by the body<span class="pagenum" id="Page151">[151]</span>
until they squarely strike the large plane surfaces,
<i>I</i>, <i>II</i>, <i>III</i>; naturally the rays of light on the faces of
the object will be retained, and cannot strike the plane
surfaces, thus leaving dark shadows of exactly the same
outlines as the block; these would be exact drawings
of the faces, and if by some means they can be fixed
and retained on the plane they can be completely
measured and dimensioned.</p>

<p>This throwing forward of the outline of the object
in different views on the planes is called projection of
the object, and furnishes a highly important means of
fixing the outlines and dimensions in the three main
directions of height, width and depth; evidently, the
light rays passing by the front face may not all reach
the plane of projection, but they may be retained by
protruding parts of the object behind the front face.
These protruding parts naturally would also be projected
on the plane in the same manner as the main
body of the block.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page152">[152]</span></p>

<p>These projections of the protruding part are plainly
visible in plane <i>II</i> and plane <i>III</i>, while the part would
not be drawn in outline in plane <i>I</i>. It may be imagined,
however, that the greater thickness of the body
in the direction of the protruding part would intensify
also the shadow, thus outlining the face of the protruding
part in plane <i>I</i>.</p>

<p>It is apparent that these three projections are all
needed, but as drawing is all done in one single plane,
the three projections will for the sake of convenience
have to be brought into a single plane. This can be
realized if plane <i>II</i> is swung around axis <i>O Z</i> and
plane <i>III</i> around axis <i>O Y</i>, until all three surfaces are
in one single plane, which would then appear as shown
in <a href="#Fig227">fig. 227</a>.</p>

<p>It is also possible to assume transparent planes in
front of the body and extend the parallel lines of sight
forward instead of backward. Thus an outline picture
will be created on each of the three planes <i>I</i>, <i>II</i>, <i>III</i> in
<a href="#Fig228">fig. 228</a>, in a manner similar to <a href="#Fig226">fig. 226</a>. For drawing
purposes, all three views again have to be brought into
a single plane, which is done by swinging <i>II</i> around
<i>O Z</i>, and <i>III</i> around <i>O Y</i> in the same manner as <a href="#Fig227">fig. 227</a>
was evolved from <a href="#Fig226">fig. 226</a>.</p>

<p>It will be noted that in <a href="#Fig229">fig. 229</a> plane <i>III</i> is now
above <i>I</i> and plane <i>II</i> on the left-hand side of <i>I</i>, while
in <a href="#Fig227">fig. 227</a> they were below and at the right-hand side
of plane <i>I</i>. As the swinging of the top and side planes
takes place around the edges of the front plane <i>I</i> two
systems may thus be distinguished, according to the
position of plane <i>I</i> in regard to the object. <a href="#Fig226">Fig. 226</a>
thus represents the system of backward projection,
while <a href="#Fig228">fig. 228</a> represents the system of forward projection.</p>

<p>Either system can have, however, the plane <i>II</i> at
the right- or left-hand side edge, while plane <i>III</i> may
be attached to the top or bottom edge of plane <i>I</i>; it
is readily understood that a number of combinations
are possible for each system, as it is not necessary to
adhere absolutely to one rule. The system of forward
projection is the one generally practiced and further
examples are all executed by this system, meaning that
the planes are always between the observer and the object.</p>

<p>For the clearness of the drawing, it is desirable to
have all corners, edges and outlines appear in such
solid lines as they appear to the eye. If, therefore,
certain sharply defined outlines occur on one side more
than on the opposite one, it is most desirable to take the
view against the side that has the most definitely
marked outlines.</p>

<p>If the opposite side should show a number of
wholly different features, it may prove even desirable
to show this side also, thus gaining four views instead
of the usual three, and so obtain a more complete
understanding of the shape of the object, besides
giving increased facilities for dimensioning each part of
the body.</p>

<p>This additional view may be taken from the sides,
as well as up or down, thus making a maximum of five
views possible by which the outside of the object may
be delineated.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig230">Fig. 230</a> shows why it may be desirable to take
five views of a block that has a receding space of different
outlines in each of the side and top and bottom
faces.</p>

<p>It is not necessary, however, to resort to five
views in such a case as is represented in <a href="#Fig230">fig. 230</a>, as the
only differing feature, the circular space in <i>III</i> bottom,
might be shown in <i>III</i> top by dotted lines, and the
difference of <i>II</i> right might be shown in <i>II</i> left, also by
dotted lines. It is desirable to show four or five views
only where great complication and consequent lack of
clearness through numerous dotted lines would result
from having a less number of views.</p>

<p>So far the projections and views have only represented
the outlines of the object; it may often be
desirable, however, to show central holes or other perforations<span class="pagenum" id="Page157">[157]</span>
or variations of sections; in this case it is
possible to imagine the object cut in slices, by planes,
through certain well defined axes, or other lines of
distinctive importance, and then take a view of this
sectional plane with its newly created intersections or
sharply marked outlines; thus, a section may often
take the place of the third, fourth or fifth view to great
advantage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page158">[158]</span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page159">[159]</span></p>

<p>It is not always possible to get a view against a
face or side of the object, but, with irregularly shaped
bodies or under special conditions, it may be necessary
to take a view of corners, sloping planes, curved
or irregularly shaped surfaces.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig231">Fig. 231</a> shows a hexagonal nut in the three normal
projections; from the top view it is readily seen
that the front view shows the side of the hexagon in a
contracted scale, and that therefore the scaling and
dimensioning for the horizontal direction have all to be
done in the top or plan view; the front and side views
convey, however, the dimension of height correctly,
and these are therefore the right places for scaling and
dimensioning in the vertical direction.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig231">Fig. 231</a> shows how a cylindrical outline appears
in the three views; the hole in the nut presents itself
as circular in the top view, while it appears in the front
and side views as a rectangle. For simple objects, it
is unnecessary to show the edges of the planes, and the
three views are grouped, as regards distances and positions,
as most convenient for the execution of the
drawing.</p>

<p>Where sloping surfaces are of irregular form, it
may be necessary to employ help lines for their full determination
in the three views. <a href="#Fig232">Fig. 232</a> shows how
the surface that is produced by a slanting cut through
a cylinder would appear in the three views. The help
lines are placed in the top view in eight equal divisions
around the circumference of the cylinder. These division
lines are shown by dotted lines on the cylinder in<span class="pagenum" id="Page160">[160]</span>
the front and side views. Their intersections, with the
sloping cut in the front view, furnish also the height
of the corresponding points for the side view.</p>

<p>The spur wheel shown on <a href="#Page163">page 163</a> is an example
of projection drawing.</p>

<p>The wheel is illustrated in three views: <a href="#Fig233235">fig. 235</a> is
a side view, or elevation; <a href="#Fig233235">fig. 234</a> is a front elevation;
<a href="#Fig233235">fig. 233</a> is a section view on <i>C D</i>. The section is projected
from the front elevation by drawing parallel
lines from the points in front elevation where the lines
are intersected by the center line <i>C D</i>, cutting the
plane of view and showing the interior shape at <i>C D</i>.</p>

<p>The side elevation, <a href="#Fig233235">fig. 235</a>, is projected from the
front elevation, <a href="#Fig233235">fig. 234</a>, by drawing parallel lines
from the edges in the front view across its face.</p>

<p>In actual drawing practice the figures should be
made about three times larger than the example, and
as follows:</p>

<p>For the front elevation draw the center lines <i>A B</i>,
<i>C D</i>, and from their point of intersection as a center,
with the compasses draw the inner circle or hole, also
the pitch line <i>E E</i>. With the dividers space this line
into nineteen equal divisions; each point on this line
will be the center of a tooth, and the distance from one
point to the next one is the pitch of the tooth.</p>

<p>Now, with the dividers mark off the thickness of
tooth at each side of these points on pitch line; with
the compasses draw the outer circle for points of teeth,
the inner circle for the root of teeth, and circles for
thickness of rim and hub; also circles representing the
fillets at rim and hub. For clearness and to prevent
confusion these lines are shown on one-half the wheel
only, terminating in center line <i>C D</i>; all the lines of
the front elevation are now complete excepting the
teeth.</p>

<p>In the drawing office it is unusual to delineate all
the teeth in a gear wheel, the lines without the teeth
as now completed being deemed sufficient, giving all
particulars; however, to prevent the error of mistaking
the circles it is well to represent one or two teeth on
the drawing.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 233.&mdash;Fig. 234.&mdash;Fig. 235.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>In the example, proceed and complete the entire<span class="pagenum" id="Page164">[164]</span>
wheel, taking on the compasses a radius equal to the
pitch of the tooth; set them on the pitch line at the
point <i>G</i>, already spaced for thickness of tooth, draw
line <i>H</i> from pitch line to root of tooth; proceed similarly
all around the circle, completing one side. Next,
reverse the operation and draw the corresponding side
of the root of tooth. Now take a radius equal to half
the space between teeth and the thickness of tooth on
pitch line, and, with center in pitch line, as shown at
<i>I</i>, draw the outside or addendum of tooth, <i>J</i>; it will be
apparent that the reverse addendum of the tooth next
adjoining can be formed at the same time, with one
setting of the compasses; finish all the teeth similarly;
the front elevation will thus be completed.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig233235">Fig. 233</a> is an excellent example of sectional drawing,
to be executed as follows:</p>

<p>First draw the center line <i>L M</i> of <a href="#Fig233235">fig. 233</a>, lay off
at each side of it half the breadth of face and of the
hub; now project, from center line <i>C D</i>, in the front
elevation, <a href="#Fig233235">fig. 234</a>, with the T-square the upper and
lower teeth, the fillets, the chamfers, the hub and center
hole, also dot in the pitch line <i>F F</i>, take the radii
and draw the fillets and chamfers; draw section lines
and the view will appear as shown in <a href="#Fig233235">fig. 233</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig233235">Fig. 235</a> is a side elevation of <a href="#Fig233235">fig. 234</a>, and is a fine
sample of projection, to be executed as follows:</p>

<p>Proceed similarly as for <a href="#Fig233235">fig. 233</a>, projecting the
lines from the outside edges of the front elevation, instead
of from the center line <i>C D</i> as in last figure, and
the end elevation will be as shown in <a href="#Fig233235">fig. 235</a>.</p>

<p>The student will be assisted in understanding this
working drawing by consulting the <a href="#Page196">pages</a> under the
heading of “Gearing.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">“Inking In” Drawings.</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>When a drawing is completely finished in penciling,
it should next be “inked in” for preservation.</p>

<p>Care should be used that the pen may be perfectly
clean; the pen should be held nearly vertical, leaning
just enough to prevent it from catching on the paper;
the pen should be held between the thumb and first
and second fingers, the knuckles being bent, so that it
may be at right angles with the length of the hand.</p>

<p>The ink should be rubbed up fresh whenever it is
about to be used, for it is better to waste a little time
in preparing ink slowly than to be at a continual
trouble with pens, which will occur if the ink is ground
too rapidly or on a rough surface.</p>

<p>To test ink, a few lines can be drawn on the
margin of a sheet, noting the shade, how the ink flows
from the pen, and whether the lines are sharp. After
the lines have dried, cross them with a wet brush; if
they wash readily, the ink is too soft; if they resist the
water for a time and then wash tardily, the ink is
good.</p>

<p>Care must be exercised not to overload the pen
with ink, and, like the pencil, the pen should always
be moved from left to right and from the bottom to
the top of the board. When inking, both “nibs” of
the pen point must rest evenly on the paper and the
pen be pressed only lightly against the T-square.
Never ink any portion of a drawing until the penciling
is complete.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page168">[168]</span></p>

<p>In inking long, fine lines it is well to go over each
line twice, without moving the T-square, trying not to
widen the line on the second passage; also see that
the pen contains ink enough to finish a line, as it is
difficult to continue with the same width of line after
re-filling.</p>

<p>To produce finished drawings, it is necessary that
no portion should be erased, otherwise the color applied
will be unequal in tone; thus, when highly finished
mechanical drawings are required, it is usual to draw
an original and to copy it. Where sufficient time cannot
be given to draw and copy, a very good way is to
take the surface off the paper with fine sand-paper
before commencing the drawing; if this be done, the
color will flow equally over any erasure it may be
necessary to make afterwards.</p>

<p>The rules of procedure in drawing the lines in
“inking” are, 1, ink in the small circles and curves;
2, ink in the larger circles and curves; 3, then all
the horizontal lines, beginning at the top of the
drawing and working downward; 4, next ink in all the
vertical lines, commencing at the left and moving back
to the right; 5, draw in the oblique lines; 6, all the
center lines and dimension and reference lines. The figuring
and lettering should be always done with India
ink, thoroughly black; the last lines to be drawn are
the section lines. The reason why irregular curves
and arcs of circles are inked in first is, that it is easier
to draw a straight line up to a curve than to take a
curve up to a straight line.</p>

<p>In practice, the flat side of the drawing-pen is laid
against the tee-square or ruler; the taper of the blade
of the pen is sufficient to throw the point enough away
from the edge to prevent blotting; the pen is drawn
from left to right and from the bottom to the top of
the board.</p>

<p>This is shown in <a href="#Fig237">fig. 237</a>, intended to represent
“short work” with the drawing-pen. The wrist is
shown resting upon the blade of the square.</p>

<div class="container w30em" id="Fig237">
<img src="images/illo169.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 237.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page169">[169]</span></p>

<div class="container w25em" id="Fig238">
<img src="images/illo170.png" alt="Drawing" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 238.</p>
</div>

<p>In a similar figure, <a href="#Fig238">238</a>, the position of the hand
holding the pen indicates the best relative posture for
inking long lines. In one of these illustrations the
work is executed principally by the wrist&mdash;in the other
by the arms and fingers working together.</p>

<p>The pen should be held with even pressure against
the straight-edge or curve. If the pressure varies, the
blades will spring and the width of the line will change.
The blades should be of such length that both will
bear equally upon the paper when the pen is inclined
slightly, so as to bring the inner blade near the straight-edge;
the angle of the pen should not be changed
while drawing any line.</p>

<p>When the inking is finished, the whole drawing
may be cleaned by rubbing it with bread which is not
greasy or so fresh as to stick to the paper. If the
paper is much soiled it may be necessary to use an
eraser. A soft pencil eraser should be used and great
care taken that the ink lines are not lightened and
broken by it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page170">[170]</span></p>

<p>To avoid the necessity of using an eraser upon a
finished drawing, instruments and paper must be kept
free from dust and dirt. The triangles and T-square
should be cleaned often, by rubbing them vigorously
upon rough, clean paper.</p>

<p>Pounce is a powder used to prevent blotting in
rewriting over erasures; it is held in a bag or small
box with a perforated lid for convenience in sprinkling
on paper; when used it should be distributed evenly
with a piece of chamois, and the surplus or loose particles
removed before applying the ink.</p>

<p>A drawing is made to be read, and the skill in inking,
as in “free-hand” and in penciling, does not consist
so much in the fineness of the lines as in their
clearness.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Lettering Drawings.</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>Lettering is an important part of making drawings,
the object aimed at being to identify any portion
by reference letter or letters; thus in <a href="#Fig239">fig. 239</a> the line
<i>A C</i> describes the
line extending from
<span class="fig239" id="Fig239"><span class="top"><img src="images/illo171.png" alt="Line" /></span>
<span class="bot">Fig. 239.</span></span></p>

<p>Any information which cannot be expressed in the
drawing is always expressed by lettering, and it is desirable
to confine the lettering of drawings to one or
two standard alphabets that are plain and distinct, and
the principles of which are easily acquired. These conditions
are fulfilled in the Gothic fonts shown on <a href="#Page173">page 173</a>.</p>

<p>Both letters and figures must be carefully made
and of uniform proportion; it is well to “lay out”
these by regular measurement before permanently
inking them. Letters should not be less than one-eighth
of an inch in height and penciled carefully
before inking.</p>

<p>On <a href="#Page173">page 173</a> are printed two forms of numerals and
letters of the alphabet; it is recommended that these
be used both for practice in free-hand and for regular
office work.</p>

<p>For easy reference, letters should not be crowded
nor allowed to interfere with one another; they should
be drawn neatly, avoiding all lines of the drawing;
plain letters are always used on mechanical drawings,
whether for title, scale, reference, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page172">[172]</span></p>

<p>Arrow-heads, figures and letters should be in black,
and made with a writing pen. A pen with a ball point
is preferable, giving an equal thickness of line, no matter
in which direction the stroke is made.</p>

<div class="container" id="Fig240">
<img src="images/illo172.png" alt="Nibs" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 240.</p>
</div>

<p>Neat, well-lettered drawings go far towards establishing
a high standing for the aspiring draughtsman.
All lettering should be done free-hand, first with the
pencil, sharpened to a fine round point, and afterwards
written in ink. For this purpose common writing pens
are best to be used; <a href="#Fig240">fig. 240</a> represents the several
numbers of the approved Gillott’s pens adapted to this
purpose.</p>

<p>In lettering, it is well, for a guide for size and
location, to draw, with a round-pointed pencil, two
horizontal lines just the height the letters are to be;
the letters are also best made with careful use of the
instruments, rather than free-hand.</p>

<p>In order to letter systematically, it is a good plan
to start with the middle letter of the inscription and
work in both directions; making too prominent letters
should be avoided, plain and distinct letters being most
desirable.</p>

<p>Finally, with an ordinary writing pen, trace over
the penciling in ink; the pencil guide lines being
erased after the letters are inked in completes the
operation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page173">[173]</span></p>

<div class="container">
<img src="images/illo173.png" alt="Letters and numbers" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page174">[174]</span></p>

<p>An important matter in connection with lettering
a drawing is the location of the letters; these should
be so placed as not to interfere with the lines of the
drawing and should clearly point out the part intended
to be described. When single letters are used, they
should be inked in before the shade or section lines are
drawn.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig241">Fig. 241</a> is an example introduced to show the
method of lettering a descriptive mechanical drawing.</p>

<p>The figure shows a “blow-off valve” of approved
design drawn in section; the letters designate the
several parts; the reading to accompany the lettering
is as follows:</p>

<p class="hind05"><b>A</b>&mdash;Inlet communicating with annular passage (<i>C</i>) to
admit steam, which blows off scale and sediment
from seat (<i>E</i>) before disc (<i>L</i>) comes in contact
with same.</p>

<p class="hind05"><b>B</b>&mdash;Plug to permit passage of rod to clean out blow-off
pipe.</p>

<p class="hind05"><b>C</b>&mdash;Annular steam passage around casing (<i>D</i>) and communicating
with inlet (<i>A</i>).</p>

<p class="hind05"><b>D</b>&mdash;Removable bronze casing, in which plug (<i>L</i>) fits
snugly.</p>

<p class="hind05"><b>E</b>&mdash;Removable bronze seat ring, which also holds casing
(<i>D</i>) in place.</p>

<p class="hind05"><b>J</b>&mdash;Slot in casing (<i>D</i>) arranged to discharge sheet of
steam from <i>C</i>, which, blowing across seat (<i>E</i>),
cleans off scale and sediment before contact with
disc (<i>L</i>).</p>

<p class="hind05"><b>K</b>&mdash;Non-rotating washer to prevent loosening of locknut
(<i>H</i>) when opening valve.</p>

faces (<i>F</i>) (<i>F</i>).</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Dimensioning Drawings.</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>To “dimension” working drawings is to place
measurements upon the parts represented, to enable
the workman to proceed without measuring the drawing
itself.</p>

<p>These dimensions should be placed so as not to interfere
with nor crowd the lines of the drawing, nor yet
interfere with one another.</p>

<p>Arrow-heads are used at the extreme points of
measurement, the figures are generally inserted midway
between the arrows; a dot and dash line reaches
from the figure to the arrow-heads, as shown below.</p>

<div class="container w20em">
<img src="images/illo176a.png" alt="Dimension" />
</div>

<p>When the dimension is short these lines are
omitted and the dimension is
placed outside the drawing, thus
<img src="images/illo176b.png" class="inline h2em" alt="Dimension" />
and connected by a curved line; at other times it is
found needful to place arrow-heads outside
the drawing and the measurement inside.
<img src="images/illo176c.png" class="inline h3em" alt="Dimension" />
</p>

<p>When the dimension is long and narrow it is
usual to carry the dimensions under the drawing by
dotted and dash lines, as shown below.</p>

<div class="container w20em">
<img src="images/illo176d.png" alt="Dimension" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page177">[177]</span></p>

<p>Arrow-heads and figures should be drawn free-hand
with a common writing pen.</p>

<p>Usually dimensions are given in inches, up to 24
inches, as it is found less confusing; for instance, if
written 1′ 1″ it may be mistaken for 11″; if written 13″
no mistake could be made.</p>

<div class="container rightfloat w03em">
<img src="images/illo177a.png" alt="Dimension" />
</div>

<p>Again, 1′ 0″ may be mistaken for 10″; if written
12″ it would not; in addition to being more
distinct, it occupies less space on the drawing. In
large measurements there is more room for the
figures, and, therefore, they can be spaced
further apart&mdash;in feet and inches.</p>

<p>All figures should be made of a fairly
large size. Vertical dimensions should read
from the right hand, thus, as shown:</p>

<p>Measurements of importance, such as
the diameter of a circle, the pitch or distance
apart of rivets and bolts, etc., should
be marked in figures on the drawing. When
rough or unfinished work is mixed with
machined or finished portions, it is usual to mark F,
or “fin.,” after the latter dimension.</p>

<p>In practice, at times, instead of dimensions reference
letters are used, thus:</p>

<div class="container w30em">

<img src="images/illo177b.png" alt="Machine part" />

<div class="centerblock">

<p>D = diam. of shaft, 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches.<br />
L = length of bearing, 3<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inches.<br />
T = thickness of collar, <sup>7</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inch.<br />
d = diam. of collar, 3<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches.</p>

</div><!--centerblock-->

</div><!--container-->

<p>Generally it is preferable to give the diameters of
turned and bored work on a section, instead of an end
drawn separately; confusion is sometimes caused by a
number of radial dimensions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page178">[178]</span></p>

<p><a href="#Fig243244">Fig. 242 and fig. 243</a> are introduced to show the
principal measurements required in practical work, and
the usual way in which such dimensions are marked
when ordering parts of machinery.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig243244">Fig. 242</a> is a pedestal, or metal frame; three views
are shown, the center figure being an elevation, the
lower figure is the plan of the base, the upper figure is
a view of the top, on which is bolted the bearing block,
it being on the outside of the center figure. The
essential measurements are marked by letters. <i>H</i> is
the vertical height from base to the seat of bearing
block: <i>L</i> being the length, and <i>W</i> the width of the
base; <i>P</i> is the length between checks, and <i>B</i> the width
of seat for bearing block; <i>C</i> is the distance from center
to center of the holding down bolt holes, and <i>T</i> is the
depth of the holes in the base; <i>K</i> is the distance from
center to center of the bolt holes in the top for bearing

<p><a href="#Fig243244">Fig. 243</a> is a hanger, or metal bracket, and shows
the center figure or elevation, the plan of the top and
the plan of the seat for bearing block, which is bolted
on the interior of the center figure. <i>H</i> is the vertical
distance from the top to the seat for bearing block;
the other measurements required are marked by letters
similar to <a href="#Fig243244">figure 242</a>.</p>

<p>Now, one of the important matters in connection
with dimensioning a drawing is the location of the figures.
One rule, whose utility cannot be gainsaid, is
that they should be so located that they can be altered
or erased without damage to the lines of the drawing,
as changes may be necessitated either by original errors
in writing down the figures or by changes in the design
being found desirable during the construction of
the machine.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Shading Drawings.</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>To produce an effect, drawings are shaded; that
is, shadow lines about twice the width of the regular
line are drawn according to a recognized rule, which
always represents the same peculiarity of form in the
same way.</p>

<p>In working drawings light lines only are permitted;
shade lines are wider than the working lines, and in
reading scale measurements the extra thickness of line
would make a difference.</p>

<p>Instead of representing the shadow as it is really
cast by the object, the edges which cast the shadow
are determined, and all the views are treated as if the
light came from behind and from the left, downwards,
at an angle of 45° to the horizontal line, as shown by
the arrows in <a href="#Fig245248">figs. 245 to 248</a>.</p>

<div class="container" id="Fig245248">

<img src="images/illo180.png" alt="Shading" />

<p class="caption">Fig. 245.&mdash;Fig. 246.&mdash;Fig. 247.&mdash;Fig. 248.</p>

</div>

<p>The lower and right-hand outlines of projecting
parts will cast shadows, and the student should make
them of extra width.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page181">[181]</span></p>

<p><a href="#Fig249">Fig. 249</a>: In shading curves, divide the center line as
before (see <a href="#Page146">page 146</a>) and describe circles from center, <i>D</i>;
these lines are not to be shaded in penciling, but when
inking. The figures represent two rings, <i>A</i> and <i>C</i>, and
spaces, <i>B</i> and <i>D</i>. The outside of a surface is shaded
according to circle 1, and the inside surface according
to circle 2. This will give the desired shading, but it
makes a drawing incorrect, and therefore shading is not
used in working drawings.</p>

<p>This shading is accomplished by inking the circle
first with regular width of line; then with the same radius
remove the point of compasses from the <i>true center</i>,
placing it outside, according to the desired position
of the shaded line, and describe an arc of a circle.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig250">fig. 250</a> divide center line as before; with the
45° triangle or set square, draw through the center the
diagonals shown by dotted lines; and through the
points <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, etc., draw the perpendiculars, cutting
the diagonals; from the points of intersection draw the
horizontal lines, completing the squares.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 250.</p>
</div>

<p>Now, take a radius
of half an inch,
and in the corner of
each square draw
with the bow-pencil
a circular arc meeting
the pencil lines
exactly; with the
bow-pen <i>ink in the
arcs</i> first, then ink
carefully the lines
joining with the
arcs; all lines must
be of the same
width; put in the
shade on arcs and
lines as in <a href="#Fig249">fig. 249</a>;
and, finally, erase
the pencil lines at
corners, etc.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Section-Lining.</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>Cross-hatching has been defined in the “preliminary
definitions” to drawing; this term represents the
practice of drawing diagonal lines representing the interior
of an object, shown as a piece cut in half or
when a piece is broken away. This is done to make
more of the parts show, or to exhibit more clearly the
nature of the materials; hence section lining and cross-hatching
tell the same thing, <i>i. e.</i>, the drawing of diagonal
lines, usually at an angle of 45°, to show that the
object is broken away and the interior designed to be
represented.</p>

</div>

<p><a href="#Fig251258">Figs. 251 to 258</a>, inclusive, show the section lining
and cross-hatching by which it is customary to represent
the various materials entering into a construction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page183">[183]</span></p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig259">fig. 259</a> is outlined a
representation of a section of
a cog-wheel; section 1 being
the wood cogs; 2, the iron
wheel, and 3 the wedges at
the root of the gear. It would
be impossible to convey the
same ideas by ordinary plan
or elevation drawing; all the objects on the same page
are more clearly represented by the use of section
lines or cross-hatching.</p>

<p>Sectioning is executed by drawing a series of parallel
lines about <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>32</sub> inches apart. Lay the 45° triangle
on the upper edge of the T-square and draw the top-most
line of the sectioning. Then slide the triangle
along the T-square for each successive line. The sectioning
should be inked in without previous penciling
and the lines should be finer than the lines of the general
drawing.</p>

<p>Various devices are in use for mechanically equalizing
the distances in section lining, but the trained
eye is the most practical method. When two abutting
pieces are sectioned, the section lining on one piece
slants in an opposite direction to that on the other.</p>

<p>To draw an object to be sectioned on both sides
of its center line, only one side is sectioned, while the
other side is drawn in full.</p>

<p>Sections are necessary in nearly all machine drawings;
they are usually taken horizontally or vertically,
but they may be taken in any direction; the position
of a section should be shown by a line upon the object;
this line is called the cutting plane.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig261">fig. 261</a> is shown the hub of a wheel, it is also a
sample of work for practice.</p>

<h3>TINTS AND COLORS.</h3>

<p>For special purposes of illustration drawings are
made which must be tinted. In such cases the paper
must be expanded and stretched evenly all over its
surface; otherwise when the moist tint is applied the
paper will wrinkle and get out of shape; to do this
cut the paper at least half an inch less in size than the
drawing board; lay the paper face down, turn up a
margin or edge of about three-fourths of an inch all
round, then dampen the paper with a sponge and clean
water; allow it to soak for a few minutes until it is
evenly dampened or moistened all over, turn the paper
upside down (face up).</p>

<p>Apply strong paste to the under side of the margin
all round; rub down, on the drawing-board, working
from the center of the board outwards so as to exclude
the air and prevent creases or furrows. The board is
then inclined and left to dry slowly; make sure that the
paper is all well pasted and every part of the edges
attached to the board.</p>

<p>If tracings are required to be tinted or shaded,
the color may be applied before the tracing is cut off,
or what is more usual, the color may be applied on the
back of the tracing; then there is no liability to wash
out the lines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page185">[185]</span></p>

<p>Mechanical drawings are seldom tinted, but are
mainly produced in India ink. Where, however, a fine
effect is desired, working drawings are colored, so as to
show at a glance the material of which the different
parts are to be made.</p>

<p>The colors required are few but should be of the
best quality. Besides India ink the following water-colors
are generally used:</p>

<p>1, Neutral-tint. 2, Prussian Blue. 3, Chrome
Yellow. 4, Gamboge. 5, Raw Sienna. 6, Carmine.
7, Vermillion. 8, Venetian Red. 9, Sepia. 10, Indigo.
These come in hard cakes.</p>

<p>Certain colors and tints represent different metals
and materials as follows:</p>

<p>Wrought Iron&mdash;Prussian Blue.</p>

<p>Steel&mdash;Carmine and Prussian Blue, mixed to give
a purple shade.</p>

<p>Steel Casting&mdash;Same as the above darkened by
Venetian Red.</p>

<p>Cast-Iron&mdash;Neutral Tint made of India Ink, indigo,
mixed with a little carmine.</p>

<p>Brass&mdash;Gamboge or Chrome Yellow.</p>

<p>Babbitt&mdash;Emerald Green; sometimes light mixture
of India Ink.</p>

<p>Copper&mdash;Purple Lake.</p>

<p>It is sometimes found necessary to prepare a highly
finished and shaded drawing of the work in hand.
Such elaborations, in fact, are much admired by the
uninitiated, although the complete shading of the
drawing is no criterion as to the scientific value of the
machine. An illustration of this is told in the note.</p>

<div class="note">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;A consulting engineer had to lay before a board of
directors plans of horizontal engines for their consideration. One
of these drawings was of a very superior machine, but being only
depicted lineally was at once rejected by them, for a highly
finished representation of a very inferior apparatus. The engineer,
wishing to induce the board to decide for the best, suggested that
the matter should be postponed to a future day, and in the meantime
had the drawing of the superior machine highly colored and
finished. At the next meeting the directors unanimously decided
that this was the very one which they preferred and had chosen.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Reproducing Drawings.</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>When once finished, one or more copies of drawings
are frequently required; these are produced, 1, by
blue printing, as described before; 2, by tracing. A
tracing is a mechanical copy of a design or drawing,
made by reproducing its lines as seen through a transparent
medium&mdash;as tracing-cloth or tracing-paper.</p>

<p>Tracing-cloth is a thin linen fabric, coated with
size; this is called <i>tracing-lines</i>; <i>tracing-paper</i> is so
prepared as to be transparent, so that it will receive
marks either in pencil or with pen and ink.</p>

<p>Tracing-cloth must be fastened to the board, over
the drawing, by pins or other tacks; moisture or dampness
should be carefully avoided and the drawing done
on the smooth side of the cloth.</p>

<p>When tracing cloth will not take ink readily a
small quantity of pounce may be applied to the surface
of the cloth and distributed evenly with a piece
of cotton waste, chamois, or similar material, but the
pounce should be thoroughly removed&mdash;by washing&mdash;before
applying the ink.</p>

<p>In making tracings the same order is followed as
described under the section “Inking”&mdash;to repeat:
1, ink in the small circles and curves; 2, ink in the
larger circles and curves; 3, then all the horizontal
lines, beginning at the top of the drawing and working
downward; 4, next ink in all the vertical lines, commencing
at the left and moving back to the right;
5, draw in the oblique lines; 6, all the center lines red
(carmine), and dimension and reference lines in blue
(Prussian blue) or <i>vice versa</i>. The figuring and lettering
should always be done with India ink, thoroughly
black.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page187">[187]</span></p>

<h3>BLUE PRINTING.</h3>

<p>Copies of drawings or parts representing details
and measurements are frequently needed for the office,
pattern shop, machine and blacksmith shop, etc. These
copies are best made by printing on sensitized or
specially prepared paper, from tracings drawn on transparent
cloth or paper, as hereabove described. The
original design may be guarded with the utmost care
for long preservation, but the blue prints, so called, are
for ready reference and use without much regard to
the length of time they are to be in existence.</p>

<p>The usual practice is to carefully trace from the
drawing on transparent cloth or paper an exact reproduction
of it, filling in all detail lettering and sizes or
figured dimensions.</p>

<p>This tracing is fixed in a frame similar to a picture
frame, with the side on which the drawing is made
next to the glass: 1, place the sensitized side of the
paper (which has been prepared previously) against the
back of the tracing; 2, fix soft padding against the
back of the paper and fasten it up so that both paper
and tracing are compressed firmly against the glass,
permitting no creases or air spaces between them.</p>

<div class="container w40em" id="Fig262">
<img src="images/illo187.jpg" alt="Blue print" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 262.</p>
</div>

<p>This should be done in a darkened room; 3, expose
for three to six minutes, according to the intensity
of the sun; 4, take the sensitized paper out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page188">[188]</span>
frame and quickly wash well in clean running cool
water, and the drawing will appear in white lines on
blue ground; 5, hang the print up by one edge so that
the water will run off and the print will soon dry and
be ready for use.</p>

<h3>TEST-PIECES.</h3>

<p>To make good blueprints, being guided only by
the appearance of the exposed edge of sensitized
paper, requires considerable experience. Very often,
especially on a cloudy day, the edge looks just about
right, but when taken out of the frame and given a
rinsing, it is only to find that the print looks pale
because it should have been allowed to remain exposed
for a longer period.</p>

<p>Now simply take a small test-piece of the same
paper (say about 4 inches square) and a piece of
tracing cloth with several lines on its surface and
lay these small pieces out at the same time the real
print is being exposed, and cover these samples
with a piece of glass about 4 inches square. As a
general rule, we can find a place on top of the frame
for the testing-piece, and by having a small dish of
water at hand for testing the print by tearing off a
small bit and washing same to note its appearance,
the novice can get just as good results as the experienced
hand without danger of failure.</p>

<h3>BLACK PROCESS COPYING.</h3>

<p>This is accomplished by specially sensitized paper
by which a fac-simile of the original drawing can be
made; that is, black lines upon white ground. It also
avoids the objection to the blue print paper of shaded
drawings which show light and shade reversed.</p>

<p>The prints made by the process are said to be
absolutely permanent and can be altered, added to or
colored the same as original drawings.</p>

<p>The sensitized paper is sold ready for use, but it
can be prepared by dissolving two ounces of citrate of
iron and ammonium in eight ounces of soft water;
keep in a dark bottle, also, one and one-third ounces of
red prussiate of potash in eight ounces of water; keep
in another dark bottle; when about to use mix an
equal quantity of each in a cup and apply in a dark
room with a soft brush or sponge to one side of white
rag paper, similar to envelope paper, let it dry and put
away in a dark place until required for use.</p>

</div><!--chapter-->

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote1"></a><a href="#FNanchor1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
<span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;A. W. Robinson, M.E., Montreal, must have all
credit for these admirable rules and regulations. They bring into
a single focus the whole science and art of mechanical drawing.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>There are drawing offices where from ten to nearly one hundred people are busily employed in making
new plans and sketches by the hundreds, and where thousands of completed drawings are filed for reference
or for changes, as these are needed in the shop management.</p>

<p>To be introduced for the first time into such a company is a trial for the “new man” both of nerve and
manners, and a test as well of skill; nothing helps more at such a time than an acquaintance with the rules
and routine of the office, for the old saying holds good in a drawing office, of “doing in Rome as the Romans
do.” The author of this book has felt this strangeness in a new position and so adds the following model-rules
for the guidance of the student when first entering a regular position in an office where many are employed
and where success depends upon a systematic ordering of the work in hand.</p>

<h3>SIZE OF DRAWINGS.</h3>

<p>1. The standard size shall be 23 inches by 36
inches, subdivided into half, quarter and eighth sheets.</p>

<p>2. Full-size drawings shall be reserved, as far as
possible, for general views and parts not capable of
being shown on smaller sheets.</p>

<p>3. All shop detail shall, as far as possible, be
shown on quarter and eighth sheets.</p>

<h3>CHARACTER OF DRAWINGS.</h3>

<p>4. Detail drawings shall, as far as possible, classify
the different kinds of works, such as castings, forgings,
shafts, levers, piping, etc. Different kinds of work
shall not be shown on the same detail drawing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page192">[192]</span></p>

<p>5. All shop drawings liable to repetition shall be
traced and blue-printed. All temporary details, requiring
only one copy, may be made on sketch sheets
and press copied.</p>

<p>6. A shop drawing is to be considered as an order
or instruction to the shop, and not merely as a statement
or illustration. For this purpose it must convey
clearly and distinctly all the information necessary
to make the article.</p>

<p>7. Every dimension necessary to the execution
of the work is to be clearly stated by figures on the
drawing, so that no measurements need to be taken in
the shop by scale. All measurements to be given with
reference to the base or starting point from which the
work should be laid out, and also with reference to
center lines.</p>

<p>8. All figured dimensions on drawings to be
plain, round vertical figures, not less than one-eighth
inch high, and formed by a line of uniform width and
sufficiently heavy to insure printing well. No thin,
sloping, or doubtful figures, or diagonal-barred fractions
will be tolerated. All figured dimensions below two
feet to be expressed in inches.</p>

<p>9. All center lines to be alternate dot and dash
in fine black line. All dimension lines to be double
dot and dash, with a central space for the figure, and of
such strength as to show on blue-print more faintly than
lines of drawing. Lines of drawing to be bold and
clearly defined in proportion to the scale, and may be
shade-lined by making the right-hand and bottom lines
heavier. No ornamental shading or other “frills”
allowed on shop drawings.</p>

<p>10. Every drawing, whether whole or half-sheet,
shall have the title, date, scale and number of the sheet
stamped in lower right-hand corner, and the quarter
and eighth sheets printed on top.</p>

<p>11. The name of the drawing, as given in the
title, is invariably to consist of two divisions in one
line separated by a hyphen. The first division is to
state the general name of the thing or machine, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page193">[193]</span>
the second name is to clearly designate the part or
parts represented (or if a general view should so state).
The wording of titles should be submitted to the chief
engineer or head draughtsman for approval.</p>

<h3>SKETCH BOOKS.</h3>

<p>23. Each draughtsman will be supplied with a
sketch book by the company, in which he shall make
all his notes, calculations and data referring to his
work, and under no circumstances shall notes of value
be made on loose sheets. Each entry should invariably
be commenced with the subject and date, and full<span class="pagenum" id="Page195">[195]</span>

based, and the results obtained clearly stated. These
books are to remain the property of the company.</p>

<h3>IN GENERAL.</h3>

<p>24. Changes in drawings, sketches or order lists
issued to the shop shall only be made when authorized
by the chief engineer, or, in his absence, by the chief

the order clerk.</p>

<p>25. The names of all similar parts in order lists
and drawings are to be uniform.</p>

<p>26. Tracings must be kept in safe, for blue-printing
purposes only. Office copies of blue-prints must
be used for references.</p>

<p>27. No drawing, print or photograph shall be
taken from office without permission.</p>

<h3>NUMBERING WORKING DRAWINGS.</h3>

<p>There are a great many different systems used in
indexing drawings, most of which have some good
points, but very few are sufficiently elastic to cover a
wide field. A plan based upon the decimal system of
notation is very simple, and, as there is no practical
limit to the number of subdivisions, it can be expanded
indefinitely. Following are the main outline
features of the system as adapted to the needs of
drawing offices belonging to large works.</p>

<p>The main division numbers, 000, 100, 200, 300, etc.,
are used respectively for all plans and general sheets
referring to the division concerned. 100 includes
general plans covering more than one department,
and all small-scale plans with cross references to departments
covered.</p>

<p>The class or tens divisions contain general
drawings of the subdivisions, the subclasses or units
divisions being limited to details only. Further subdivisions
would probably be necessary in some cases.
A card index with cross references and written by
someone who knew what to do is an essential part
of the system.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Gearing.</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>Under this heading the author has grouped some information relating to a subject of wide interest and one
sure to interest a student of mechanical drawing.</p>

<p>The diagrams are intended for exercises in drawing, <i>i. e.</i>, to be redrawn as parts of practice; the text is to be
studied not only for the good to be gained from the study of gearing, but as an example of the way in which
written or printed descriptions are necessary to explain a subject illustrated by drawings.</p>

<p><i>A gear</i> is primarily a toothed wheel; gearing is a
train of toothed wheels for transmitting motions; there
are two chief sorts of toothed gearing, viz., spur gearing
and bevel gearing.</p>

<p><i>A spur wheel</i> has teeth around the edge pointing
to the center; commencing at the center, a spur wheel
may be said to consist of a hole, square, octagonal or
round, for its axle or shaft; a hub; the web, body or
arms; a rim, and the teeth; see <a href="#Fig263">fig. 263</a>.</p>

<p><i>A spur wheel</i> has teeth on its circumference which
run parallel to its shaft; wheels as shown in <a href="#Fig271">fig. 271</a> are
termed <i>helical wheels</i>; these are similar to spur wheels
except their teeth are arranged upon different angles
to the shaft.</p>

<p><i>A bevel</i> is a slant or inclination of a surface from a
right line, hence a bevel wheel is one whose teeth stand
beveling or at an oblique angle to the shaft, or towards
the center; see <a href="#Fig267">fig. 267</a>.</p>

<p><i>Miter wheels</i> are bevel wheels of the same size,
working at right angles with one another; see <a href="#Fig268">fig. 268</a>.</p>

<p><i>The diameter of both spur and bevel wheels</i> is
measured and calculated neither from the outside nor
from the bottom of the teeth, but on the pitch circle.
When we speak of the diameter of a spur or bevel<span class="pagenum" id="Page200">[200]</span>
wheel, we mean the diameter of the pitch circle, without
any reference to the form of tooth.</p>

<p><i>The addendum circle</i> of a toothed wheel is as
shown in illustration, <a href="#Fig264">fig. 264</a>; <i>addendum</i> means “something
added,” and, as shown in the figure, it is the part
added beyond the pitch “line” or circle.</p>

<div class="container w40em" id="Fig264">
<img src="images/illo200.png" alt="Definitions" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 264.</p>
</div>

<p><i>The pitch line</i> is the most important one in gearing;
the “pitch line” or “pitch circle” is supposed to be
the working circle. This is shown in P&mdash;P in <a href="#Fig274">fig. 274</a>.</p>

<p><i>The periphery</i> of a wheel is the extreme circumference,
as N in <a href="#Fig274">fig. 274</a>.</p>

<p>All parts of gear-wheels consist of portions, to
which have been given generally accepted names.
<a href="#Fig264">Fig. 264</a> shows the “addendum circle” and the “pitch
line” as marked. The teeth and rim are shown in
white, and the other portions are indicated by the names.</p>

<p><i>The circular pitch line</i>, as opposed to the diametral
pitch, is the same as the pitch circle. It is a line which
bisects all the teeth of a toothed wheel.</p>

<p><i>The rolling circle</i> is the same as the circular
pitch line.</p>

<p><i>Diametral</i> means pertaining to a diameter or the
length of a diameter; hence a diametral pitch is a
system of measures or enumeration based upon the
diameter instead of the circular pitch line; it is used
very generally in spacing for fine tooth gear. Wheels
of this description usually have their teeth cut in a
gear-cutting machine, <i>i. e.</i>, medium and fine tooth
gears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page201">[201]</span></p>

<div class="container rightfloat w15em" id="Fig265">
<img src="images/illo201.png" alt="Cog wheel" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 265.</p>
</div>

<p><i>A cog wheel</i> is the general name for any wheel
which has a number of cogs placed around its circumference.</p>

<p>When the teeth of a wheel are
made of the same material and
formed of the same piece as the
body of the wheel, they are called
<i>teeth</i>; when they are made of wood
or some other material and fixed to
the circumference of the wheel, they
are called <i>cogs</i>; see <a href="#Fig265">fig. 265</a>.</p>

<p><i>A pinion</i> is a small wheel. When two toothed
wheels act upon one another, the smaller is generally
called the pinion. The terms <i>trundle</i> and <i>lantern</i> are
applied to small wheels having cylindrical bars instead
of teeth. The teeth in pinions are sometimes termed
<i>leaves</i>; in a trundle, <i>staves</i>. See <a href="#Fig273">fig. 273</a>.</p>

<p>The wheel which acts is called a <i>leader</i> or <i>driver</i>;
and the wheel which is acted upon by the former is
called a <i>follower</i> or the <i>driven</i>. When a screw or <i>worm</i>
revolves in the teeth of a wheel, the latter is termed a
<i>worm wheel</i> or <i>worm gear</i>; see <a href="#Fig270">fig. 270</a>. When a
pinion acts with a rack having teeth, we speak of <i>rack</i>
and pinion. When the teeth are on the inside of the
rim, and not on the periphery, the wheel is termed an
<i>internal gear</i>; see <a href="#Fig272">fig. 272</a>.</p>

<p>Two wheels acting upon one another in the same
plane are called <i>spur gear</i>; the teeth are parallel with
the axis. When wheels act at an angle, they are
called <i>bevel gear</i>.</p>

<p><i>Friction gear-wheels</i> are those which communicate
motion one to the other by the simple contact of
their surfaces.</p>

<p>In frictional gearing the wheels are toothless and
one wheel drives the other by means of the friction
between the two surfaces which are pressed together.</p>

<p>Grooved friction wheels are used to give greater
cohesion than can be obtained by the plain surface.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page202">[202]</span></p>

<p><a href="#Fig263">Fig. 263</a> shows a pair of spur-wheels in
gear. The dotted circles which meet are
the rolling circles, called the “pitch line”
or “pitch circle.”</p>

<div class="container w30em" id="Fig266">
<img src="images/illo202.png" alt="Spur mortise wheel" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 266.</p>
</div>

<p>A spur mortise wheel is similarly
shown in <a href="#Fig266">fig. 266</a>; it is very like in appearance
to a spur wheel; it differs essentially
in that the teeth are separate cogs,
fixed in singly to the rim; see also <a href="#Fig265">fig. 265</a>,
<a href="#Page201">page 201</a>.</p>

<div class="note">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The teeth of spur wheels cast from a
pattern must of necessity be larger at one side than
at the other, because the teeth must have taper to
permit the extraction of the pattern from the
mould; therefore, in fixing wheels to gear, the
large side of one should meet the smaller side of
the other; should the two large sides come together
the teeth will meet only at the large side,
and the teeth will probably break away from the
excessive strain on that point.</p>

</div><!--note-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page203">[203]</span></p>

<p><i>Skew gearing</i> are bevel wheels working out of
center; the teeth do not form radial lines from the
wheel center.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig267">Fig. 267</a> shows a pair of bevel wheels in gear as
described on <a href="#Page199">page 199</a>. A bevel mortise wheel, <i>i. e.</i>,
one having cogs inserted in its rim instead of teeth.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 267.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page204">[204]</span></p>

<p>A bevel wheel and pinion must be made to suit
one another by both having teeth forming together an
angle of 90°, therefore they are pairs, or proportioned
in the number of teeth one to the other. Any other
proportion used would not exactly gear and would be
termed a “bastard” gear.</p>

<div class="container w30em" id="Fig268">
<img src="images/illo204.png" alt="Miter wheels" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 268.</p>
</div>

<p><a href="#Fig268">Fig. 268</a> represents a pair of miter wheels in gear;
it will be noted that the shafts, when connected, will
be at right angles to each other, the wheels being in
all particulars of the same dimensions; the figure
answers the purpose of a much longer description, if
given in words.</p>

<p>A miter-wheel can easily be known by putting
a square upon the face of the teeth, which are always
at an angle of 45° with one another, irrespective
of size.</p>

<p><i>A miter-wheel</i> is a particular kind of bevel-wheel,
the bevel being limited to an angle of 45° in each
wheel.</p>

<p>The curve of the teeth in bevel-gears, when correctly
formed, changes constantly from one end of the
tooth to the other, therefore bevel-gears whose teeth
are produced with a forced cutter are not theoretically
correct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page205">[205]</span></p>

<p><a href="#Fig269">Fig. 269</a>
represents a
rack and pinion:
the teeth
in this form of
gear are shaped
similarly to
those in the spur
wheel, shown on
<a href="#Page198">page 198</a>, with
the difference
that the teeth
of one are on a circle and
on the rack are made on
a straight line.</p>

<p>A flange or addition
to the end of a tooth and
the rim connecting them
together is used to
strengthen the teeth. This
extends from the root to
pitch line when the wheel
and pinion are both
flanged: if only one is
flanged it extends from
the root to the addendum.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig270">Fig. 270</a> illustrates a worm and
a worm wheel, sometimes called
screw gears. This is a slow but
powerful method of transmitting
power, one revolution of the worm
only moving the wheel the distance
of one tooth and space.</p>

<p><i>A worm gear</i> is a spur wheel
with teeth at an angle to the axis,
so as to work with a worm which
is a <i>screw</i>, or has teeth shaped in
the form of a spiral wound round
its circumference; the screw or
worm is called an endless screw,
because it never comes to a stopping
place in the circumference of
the wheel.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig271">Fig. 271</a> represents a gear with helical teeth. It is similar to a spur wheel, and is used
in place of same in heavy and slow moving machinery, the formation of teeth preventing&mdash;in
large measure&mdash;the jar or concussion noticeable in common spur gears.</p>

<p>In recent years the speed at which gearing is run has been greatly increased. A
striking instance is that of a pair of <i>cast-iron</i> helical wheels, 6 ft. 3 in. diameter, 12 in.
wide, making 220 revolutions
per minute, the speed of the
pitch line being 4,319 feet per
minute; these wheels are running
continuously and with
little noise. There is also a <i>cut</i>
gear in a mill in Massachusetts,
30 feet in diameter, and the
speed of pitch line is 4,670 feet
per minute.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 272.</p>
</div>

<p><i>An internal or annular gear wheel</i> is one in which the faces of the teeth are within
and the flank without the pitch circle, hence the pinion operates within the wheel.
See <a href="#Fig272">fig. 272</a>.</p>

<p>In internal geared wheels there is almost an entire absence of friction and consequent
wear of the teeth, as compared to ordinary spur gearing.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Designing Gears.</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>This section is introduced into the work for a double purpose; 1, as an exercise in drawing; 2, as a study in
accurate measurements. It is a sample of the work that the advanced student in mechanical drawing will be
confronted with as he puts in practice the theory of the art of drawing.</p>

<p>Some sample rules are given in the following pages to aid in calculations relating to gears, and still others are
given under the <a href="#Page269">section</a> “Useful Rules and Tables” at the end of the volume; these are to be carefully studied.</p>

<p>To accurately divide the pitch circle of a gear
wheel by hand requires both patience and skill. On
the accuracy of spacing lies the essential requisite of a
good gear wheel.</p>

<p>The drawing in plate, <a href="#Fig274">fig. 274</a>, illustrates a pair
of spur wheels, shown in gear, the office instructions
for which being:</p>

<p>“Required, <i>a detail plan</i> of a pair of spur wheels;
dimensions: wheel, 76 teeth, 3<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches pitch, 7-inch
eye, 6 arms; pinion, 19 teeth; scale, 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches = 1
foot.”</p>

<p>The drawing, as illustrated, is the result of the
above instructions, all pencil lines being removed, and
this result is worked out as follows:</p>

<p>76 teeth × 3<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches, pitch = 266 inches in circum.
= 7 ft. 0<sup>11</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> in. diam. = 3 ft. 6<sup>11</sup>&#8260;<sub>32</sub> in. radius; with this
measurement as represented on scale, draw line <i>P P</i> on
drawing. This is called the pitch line.</p>

<p>Draw next diameter line, produce or extend this
diameter line for pinion, and with radius of 10<sup>19</sup>&#8260;<sub>32</sub> (19
teeth × 3<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>) from pitch line of wheel, draw pitch line of
pinion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page210">[210]</span></p>

<p>Take any point in this pitch line of wheel, mark
off 3<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches as represented on scale, mark this around
the pitch line, it will be the center of each of the 76
teeth; then the breadth of thickness of each tooth
(= pitch × 0.475) must be marked from these centers,
then mark from <i>P L</i>, length of tooth to point (= pitch
× 0.35) and <i>P L</i> to root (= pitch × 0.4), draw circles for
outside of teeth <i>N</i> and root of tooth <i>O</i>; now with
compass set to the pitch (3<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>) of the wheel, draw the
outer portion from pitch line of tooth.</p>

<p>The radius will center in the pitch line of next
tooth where thickness of tooth has been marked; after
finishing outer portion of both sides of teeth, set the
compass from <i>center</i> of tooth with radius to the thickness
marked on pitch line and draw the portion of tooth
from pitch line to root.</p>

<p>Now mark off with dividers and draw thickness of
rim (= pitch × 0.5), divide this line into six parts, draw
radii for centers of arms; draw the bore hole 7″ and
the thickness of metal for hub same as pitch.</p>

<p>On radii lines of arms, draw the breadth of arm at
rim (= pitch and thickness of tooth), increase in breadth
approaching the center (1″ per foot), draw the thickness
of feather of arm (= pitch × 0.35); draw web on
inside of rim (= pitch × 0.375); fill in arcs for the joining
of arms in rim and hub (radii = pitch × 0.8) and
feather to rim and hub (radii = pitch × 0.37).</p>

<p>Proceed in similar manner, completing the teeth
of pinion, and when pencil lines are all in, ink the drawing,

<p>The number of teeth, their
proportions, pitch and diameter of
pitch circle are frequently determined
on the “Manchester” principle.
This system originated in
Manchester (Eng.), and is now
generally used in the United States
for determining diameters and
number of teeth, which, of course,
regulate speeds. The principle is
not applicable to large wheels, but
is limited in its application to small
wheels, or wheels having “fine
pitch,” as will be seen in the following
explanation, which is introduced
as very useful and indispensable
knowledge for the acquisition
of the student in mechanical
drawing.</p>

<div class="container w45em" id="Fig275">
<img src="images/illo212.png" alt="Gear" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 275.</p>
</div>

<p>The “pitch” of teeth has
already been stated to be the distance
from center of one tooth to
the center of another on the “pitch
line,” measured on the chord of<span class="pagenum" id="Page213">[213]</span>
the arc. In determining the number of teeth or pitch
of wheels on this principle, the pitch is reckoned
on the <i>diameter</i> of the wheel, <i>in place of the circumference</i>,
and distinguished as wheels of “4 pitch,” “6
pitch,” “8 pitch,” etc. In other words, this means
that there are four, six, or eight teeth in the circumference
of the wheel for every inch of diameter.</p>

<p>In designing gears to transmit power the stress on
a tooth is calculated; it determines the breadth or
width and also the thickness of the tooth on pitch line;
the space between the teeth is in proportion to the
thickness of tooth, and the thickness of both combined
(one tooth and one space), measured on the pitch line
or circle, is the pitch of the wheel.</p>

<p>From the pitch all the proportions and measurements
for the sizes and strength of the parts of the wheel
are taken <i>by rule</i>, and a symmetrical form is produced.</p>

<p>In machine drawing the practice is to represent
wheels by circles only; the teeth are never shown
except on enlarged details and then only in very rare
instances; the circles drawn are always the <i>pitch lines</i>
or the rolling points of contact of the wheels.</p>

<p>The addendum circle is seldom if ever used in
practical drawing. Should it be necessary to show it
in an exceptional case, the circle would be represented
by “dotted” line.</p>

<p>The shape of tooth and mode of constructing it,
as practiced in drawing offices, differs from the true
theoretical curve of the tooth, although very minutely.</p>

<p>In all calculations for the speed of toothed gears the
estimates are based upon the pitch line, the latter standing
in the same place as the circumference of a pulley.</p>

<p>To find the <i>diameter of a gear-wheel</i> multiply the
number of teeth by the pitch, divide by 3.1416.</p>

<p>To find the <i>pitch of a gear-wheel</i> multiply the diameter
by 3.1416 and divide by the number of teeth.</p>

<p>To find the <i>number of teeth in a gear-wheel</i> multiply
the diameter by 3.1416 and divide by the pitch.</p>

<p>The <i>breadth of wheels</i>, where practicable, should be
at least three times the pitch.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 276.</p>
</div>

<p><a href="#Fig276">Fig. 276</a> shows a scale for proportions of teeth; it
is divided into tenths and used thus:</p>

<p>Say wheel is 2″ pitch, then from pitch circle to
addendum will be 3<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> tenths, and from pitch circle to
root of tooth will be 4 tenths measured at the 2″ line
on scale, and so on.</p>

<p>The decimal proportions already given in example,
page 210, are adopted in many workshops. Many
others use the proportions approved of by Sir William
Fairbairn, which are:</p>

<p>Table of proportion of gears:</p>

<p>The diameter of a wheel or pinion is invariably the
diameter measured on pitch circle, except it is specially
described otherwise, thus the diameter “over all,” etc.</p>

<p>The shape of the curved face of the teeth of gears
extending from the root to the addendum is the curve
conforming to the passage of the teeth described on
its fellow entering and leaving, as they rotate or roll
together on their pitch circles.</p>

<p>The curve of teeth outside the pitch circle is called
“the face,” and the curve from pitch circle to root is
called “the flank.”</p>

<p>The difference between the width of a space and
the thickness of a tooth is called clearance or side
clearance.</p>

<p>The play or movement permitted by clearance is
called the backlash; clearance is necessary to prevent
the teeth of one wheel becoming locked in the spaces
of the other.</p>

<p>Wheels are in gear or geared together when their
pitch lines engage, <i>i. e.</i>, when the pitch circles meet.</p>

<p>Wheels to be geared together must have their
teeth spaced the same distance apart, or in other
words, of the same pitch.</p>

<p>The teeth of spur wheels are arranged on its
periphery parallel to the wheel axis, or shaft on which
it is hung.</p>

<p>The teeth of a bevel wheel or bevel gears are
always arranged at an angle to the shaft.</p>

<p>When the <i>teeth</i> of bevel gears form an angle of
45° they are called miter wheels.</p>

<p>Miter wheels to gear must be of equal sizes.</p>

<p>A crown wheel is a disc that has teeth which are
on its side face; that is, teeth on a flat circular
surface all parallel to the axis of the wheel.</p>

<p>A rack has teeth on a flat surface or plane all
parallel to one another.</p>

<p>A gear cut by machine is called a <i>cut gear</i>. It has
teeth with less clearance than cast wheels, which are
not so true or perfect, and therefore require more
clearance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page216">[216]</span></p>

<p>A worm with even a light load is liable to heat
and cut if run at over 300 feet of rubbing surface
travel. The wheel teeth will keep cool, as they form
part of a large radiating surface; the worm itself is so
small that its heat is dissipated slowly.</p>

<p>A worm throws a severe end thrust or strain on
its shaft.</p>

<p><i>Steel Gears.</i>&mdash;There is great economy in the use
of cast-steel over cast-iron in gears; the average life of
the former is nearly twice as great as of cast-iron gears.
And, apart from their longer life and efficiency, there
is less danger of breaking.</p>

<p>The most accurate teeth, strongest and most
uniform in wearing, are to be found in steel gears cut
from solid stock, or made by cutters of proper shape.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig275">Fig. 275</a> shows an elevation and a vertical section
of a spur wheel. From these views the various parts
in spur gears can be better understood, as they are
represented here in combination, and the wheel in its
entirety.</p>

<p><i>AA</i> is the horizontal center line, <i>BB</i>, <i>BB</i> the vertical
center lines, <i>II</i> and <i>II</i> the pitch lines, <i>N</i> thickness
of tooth, <i>O</i> space of tooth, <i>D</i> total depth of tooth,
<i>C</i> breadth of face, <i>F</i> diameter on pitch line, <i>P</i> diameter
over all, <i>G</i> diameter of hub, <i>E</i> diameter of hole, <i>H</i> depth
of hole, <i>L</i> thickness of rim, <i>M</i> thickness of web.</p>

<p>Much has been and still is being written on gearing.
No general rule is followed by the writers; the elementary
principles given will enable the student to master
spur gearing, and bevel and combinations of many
kinds of wheels will afterwards be found easier to
delineate than the numerous lines seem to indicate.</p>

<p>From the “plans” made in the office are produced “working drawings”&mdash;which represent in detail the work
to be done to exact measurement and of material, as indicated, by the pattern-maker, the foundry, the forge, the
shop, and finally, by the erector of the completed mechanism.</p>

<p>How to satisfactorily fulfill the directions contained in these drawings, representing only a part of the work, so
that it will fit, with needed accuracy, to all other parts of the design, is the task before each separate worker.</p>

<p>It is by means of this division of the process of
manufacture through these drawings, that scores and
hundreds of men can be employed at the same time
upon a single engine or machine; thus, while handwork
has been superseded by machines in many quarters,
the art of drawing has not been narrowed nor
diminished, for no drawings or designs have yet been
made by machinery, nor are they likely to be.</p>

<p>It is thus that a good designer and draughtsman
“projects” or extends himself, to the advantage of
many fellow workers.</p>

<p>The drawing, <a href="#Fig277">fig. 277</a>, shows a simple form of pillar
crane: it consists of an upright cast-iron pillar, which is
bolted on a cap stone, under which is the foundation plate
not shown in the drawing; the boom is of rolled steel,
supported by steel tie rods, and provided with rollers
at the base; the hoisting gear is shown in broken
lines and circles; all as seen in the drawing.</p>

with 27 holes in each side for the bending pins. The
frame and cylinders are made of cast iron, the rams of
machinery steel, and the slides for holding the bending
blocks, of steel casting. The distance between
the bending blocks is 17 inches. The cylinders are
copper lined, 8 inches diameter, and the rams have
a 6-inch stroke. The rams, which are independent
and single acting, are returned by counterweights
placed as shown under the table. The cylinders can
be operated independently from either side of the
machine by an arrangement of valves and levers.
The machine complete weighs about 7,500 lbs.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">To Read Working Drawings.</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>One of the advantages resulting from a knowledge of practical draughting is, that it enables a mechanic to
<i>read</i> a drawing when given him as a guide for his work. It is getting every day more general among draughtsmen
to figure exactly and minutely every part of their drawings which are made to a scale.</p>

<p>Drawings are almost always made “finished size,”
that is, the dimensions are for the work when it is
completed. Consequently all the figures written on
the different parts indicate the exact size of the work
when finished, without any regard to the size of the
drawing itself, which may be made to any reduced and
convenient scale.</p>

<p>Even in full size drawings this system of figuring
is not objectionable. It is a system which should be
followed whenever a drawing is made “to work to,”
for it allows the workman to comprehend at a glance
the size of his work and the pieces he has to get made.
Figuring makes a drawing comprehensible even to
those who cannot make drawings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page230">[230]</span></p>

<p>A working drawing should be made, primarily, as
plain as possible by the draughtsman; second, the
workman should patiently and carefully study it, so
that it is thoroughly understood.</p>

<p>In studying a drawing, the object it is intended to
represent should be made as familiar as possible to the
mind of the student, so that he may fill out in imagination
the parts designedly left incomplete&mdash;as in a
gear wheel where only two or three teeth are drawn in,
that he may see, mentally, the whole.</p>

<p>The following is a description of reading drawings
when dimensions are not figured. Here we have a
piece of machinery represented by <a href="#Fig290291">fig. 290</a>, and the
information we have is that it is to scale, three inches
= one foot. Now, with scale and dividers, we can
arrive at its actual dimensions.</p>

<p>Measurements should be first taken <i>with the
dividers from the drawing</i>, and then the dividers
applied to the scale to which the drawing is made;
this scale is always marked on the working drawing; if
the dividers are set to the length of the base of the
example, <a href="#Fig290291">fig. 290</a>, they will measure, on an ordinary
two-foot rule, three and three-fourths inches, <i>but if
applied to the three-inch scale they will read</i> one foot
three inches, the actual length of the part; the “reading”
is from the scale; thus, in both figures the drawings
are “three-inch scale.”</p>

<p>Now, 3 inches is one-fourth of a foot, hence
3<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> × 4 = 1 ft. 3 in., the full size, and so on for all
parts of the drawing.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig290291">Fig. 291</a> shows <i>a side view</i> of the “steady rest,”
illustrated in front elevation, <a href="#Fig290291">fig. 290</a>; from the scale
as before we get the sizes; the two views combined
give length, breadth and thickness of the parts.</p>

<p>In some figures it is necessary to show end views,
also section views, to enable all measurements to be
read from the drawing.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Patent Office Drawing Rules.</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<h3 class="center">U. S. PATENT OFFICE RULES.</h3>

<h4>AS APPLIED TO PREPARATION OF DRAWINGS.</h4>

<p>Each applicant for a patent is required by law to
furnish a drawing of his invention whenever the nature
of the case admits of it. The drawing must be signed
by the inventor or the name of the inventor may be
signed on the drawing by his attorney-in-fact, and in
either case must be attested by two witnesses. The
drawing must show every feature of the invention
covered by the claims.</p>

<p>When the invention consists of an improvement
on an old machine, the drawing must exhibit, in one or
more views, the invention proper, disconnected from
the old structure, and also, in another view, so much
only of the old structure as will clearly show the connection
of the invention with the old machine.</p>

<p>Several editions of the patent-drawings are printed,
the smallest of which is about 3 × 4<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inches, so that the
drawing must be so made that it will stand a reduction
of about one-fourth. This work is done by the photo-lithographic
process, and therefore the character of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page234">[234]</span>
original drawing must be brought as nearly as possible
to a uniform standard of excellence suited to the
requirements of the process.</p>

<div class="note">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;These rules will be found most useful to many
readers of this work&mdash;hence their introduction at this point.
Nearly 50,000 patents are “applied for” in the United States
every year.</p>

</div><!--note-->

<p>The following rules are given by the Patent Office
for guidance:</p>

<p>1. Drawings must be made upon pure white
paper of a thickness corresponding to three-sheet
Bristol board. The surface of the paper must be
calendered and smooth. India ink alone must be used,
so as to secure perfectly black and solid lines.</p>

<p>2. The size of a sheet on which a drawing is
made must be exactly 10 × 15 inches. One inch from
its edges a single marginal line is to be drawn, leaving
the “sight” precisely 8 × 13 inches. Within this margin
all work and signatures must be included. One of the
shorter sides of the sheet is regarded as its top, and
measuring downwardly from the marginal line, a space
of not less than 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inches is to be left blank for the
heading of title, name, number and date.</p>

<p>3. All drawings must be made with the pen only.
Every line and letter, signature included, must be
absolutely black. This direction applies to all lines,
however fine, to shading, and to lines representing cut
surfaces in sectional views. All lines must be clean,
sharp, and solid, and they must not be too fine or
crowded. Surface shading, when used, should be open.
Sectional shading should be made by oblique parallel
lines about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>20</sub> of an inch apart. Solid black should not
be used for sectional or surface shading.</p>

<p>4. Drawing must be made of the fewest lines
possible, consistent with cleanness. The plane upon
which a sectional view is taken should be indicated by
a broken or dotted line. Heavy lines on the shade
side of objects should be used, except where they tend
to thicken the work and obscure letters of reference.
The light is always supposed to come from the upper
left hand corner at an angle of 45 degrees.</p>

<p>5. The scale to which a drawing is made should
be large enough to show the mechanism without
crowding. The number of sheets used must never be
more than is absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>6. The different views should be consecutively
numbered. Letters and figures of reference must be
carefully formed. They should, if possible, measure
at least one-eighth of an inch in height.</p>

<p>If the same part of an invention appears in more
than one view of the drawing it must always be represented
by the same character.</p>

<p>7. The signature of the inventor is to be placed
in the lower right-hand corner of each sheet, and those
of the witnesses at the lower left-hand corner.</p>

<p>The title should be written with pencil on the back
of the sheet.</p>

<p>Drawings should be rolled for transmission, never
folded.</p>

<p>On <a href="#Page235">page 235</a>, <a href="#Fig292">fig. 292</a> exhibits a reproduction of a
patent office drawing, used in connection with specification
papers in an application for a United States
patent.</p>

<h4>ENGLISH PRACTICE.</h4>

<p>The rules for patent drawings in England are
practically the same as in the United States; the
paper sizes are, however, different. They must be on
sheets of one of the two following sizes (the smaller
being preferable), 13 inches at the sides by 8 inches
at the top and bottom, or 13 inches at the sides by 16
inches at the top and bottom, including margin, which
must be one-half an inch wide.</p>

<p>If there are more figures than can be shown on
one of the smaller-sized sheets, two or more of these
sheets should be used in preference to employing the
large size. When an exceptionally large drawing is
required, it should be “<i>continued</i>” on subsequent
sheets. There is no limit to the number of sheets that
may be sent in.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Useful Hints and “Points.”</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>Many of these “points” are repetitions, with but little variation from the way they have been previously
stated; they are thus repeated to emphasize their practical worth.</p>

<p>A good draughtsman leaves his work in such a
state that any competent person can without difficulty
ink in what he has drawn.</p>

<p>The criterion of a good set of drawings is that
with a properly prepared specification they are complete
in themselves and require no explanation.</p>

<p>A “break” in a figure or object in a drawing is
shown in rough irregular lines, as in <a href="#Fig134">fig. 134</a>, on <a href="#Page131">page
131</a>; this is useful when the paper is not large enough
to show the whole.</p>

<p>Never use a sloping line in writing fractions on a
drawing. The objection arises from the fact that such
a dimension as 1<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub>, if written with the inclined line,
unless very distinctly executed, may be read as <sup>13</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub>.</p>

<p>In inking do not draw the lines further than you
wish them to go, but in penciling it is well to extend
the lines, free up.</p>

<p>Never use a scale for a ruler.</p>

<p>Do not overload the pen with ink.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page240">[240]</span></p>

<p>Having filled the pen, nearly close the nibs and
try the width of the line on a piece of paper or the
margin of the drawing.</p>

<p>Never refill or lay the pen aside without first cleaning
it.</p>

<p>The application of the science of geometry to the
drawing-board is absolutely necessary to success, for
the reason that the whole fabric of mechanical drawing
rests on the principles of geometry, which is well
termed the science of measurements.</p>

<p>Section lines should be the last inked and always
without previous penciling.</p>

<p>Center lines are necessary in working drawings.</p>

<p>In choosing T-squares, care should be exercised to
see that the head slides up and down the <i>left</i>-hand side
of the board easily, and that when pressed against the
board with the left hand there is no “slogging” of the
blade up or down, or in other words, that the head is
bearing firmly for its whole length against the board.</p>

<p>The best place for the title of a drawing is said to
be the upper left-hand corner; this facilitates the filing
of the sheet.</p>

<p>Never use a soft pencil except for finishing in
shadow lines.</p>

<p>The rubber should always be kept clean.</p>

<p>Great care should be taken to keep drawing boards
out of the way of heat or damp, as these cause the
wood to warp.</p>

<p>Circles and curves are to be “inked in” before
straight lines. First ink the smallest and afterwards
the larger curves.</p>

<p>Do not press heavily on the pencil so as to cut the
paper, but draw lightly, so that the mark can be erased
and leave no trace, especially if the drawing is to be
inked.</p>

<p>The draughtsman should commence his work at
the top of the paper, keeping the lower part covered
over until he needs to use it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page241">[241]</span></p>

<p>Shade lines should be avoided in all working
drawings, as their use interferes with accurate measurements.</p>

<p>To make ink stick to the tracing cloth, with a
woolen cloth rub some powdered chalk or pounce over
the surface on which the ink lines are to be drawn, then
wipe the surface clean and use a good quality of ink.</p>

<p>For striking small circles a small bow pen should
be used.</p>

<p>To fix lead pencil marks on sketches so that they
cannot be readily erased, sponge them with milk carefully
skimmed, then lay blotting paper over them and
iron with a hot flat-iron.</p>

<p>To have the ink preserve its fluidity and to keep
out all dirt and dust, keep the cover on the ink slab;
the mistake is often made of putting too liberal a supply
of water in ink well, which causes a waste of both
time and ink; no more should be prepared than to
meet immediate requirements.</p>

<p>Always draw on the right side of the sheet, which
can be found by holding the sheet up to the light and
looking across its surface with the eye nearly in the
same plane as the paper; note which side is the smoothest
and has the least number of blemishes on it; this is
the right side to draw on.</p>

<p>As to sharpening pencils, it is always best to cut a
chisel point on the pencil used for drawing, and put a
circular point on the pencils in the bow pencil and
pencil leg. The chisel point makes a finer line and
lasts much longer than a round point.</p>

<p>The varnish used in many large drawing-rooms is
simply white shellac dissolved in alcohol; it requires a
little experience to mix these to a proper consistency,
but this is soon acquired.</p>

<p>Never sharpen your pencil over the drawing.</p>

<p>A center line of a drawing is the line upon which
the figure is to be constructed; the center line is the
first line to be drawn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page242">[242]</span></p>

<p>The T-square belongs to the left side of the drawing-board,
and is operated by the left hand. The right
hand should be kept free for the purpose of picking up
pencil, pen and bows, adjusting and marking off. The
left hand controls the T-square and the triangle that
slides along the upper edge of the square; the right
hand is for the instruments.</p>

<p>The advantage of a paper rule or scale is that the
paper will expand and contract under varying degrees
of atmospheric moisture the same as the drawing does.</p>

<p>Avoid rubbing out and constantly cleaning the
drawing with India rubber; if wrong lines are made or
it is desired to make alterations, the part to be changed
should be rubbed out and completely re-drawn.</p>

<p>When using the bows see to it that the steel-pointed
leg that is put down first on the paper, to
secure a center for a curve or a circle, is a trifle longer
than the pencil or pen leg.</p>

<p>To clearly indicate the position of a center which
is to be used again, lightly pencil a small circle about
it; never put the point of a pencil in the center hole
to enlarge or blacken it; the prick point made by the
dividers and needle points should be no more than can
be just seen, hence the circle to be made as advised
above.</p>

<div class="container rightfloat w07em" id="Fig294">
<img src="images/illo244.jpg" alt="Drawing case" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 294.</p>
</div>

<p>Be particular in having the legs of the dividers
exactly the same length, and sharp, so that in pricking
off distances, and dimensions, and centers, the indent
or hole made in the paper is as small as possible.</p>

<p>The term “plane” means a perfectly flat surface;
that is, something which has length and breadth but
no thickness.</p>

<p>The best way to indicate on the drawing the surfaces
which are to be finished is to write on the lines
which represent the finished surfaces “finished,” tool-finish,
or “faced,” according to the degree of finish required.
The single letter <i>f</i> is frequently used.</p>

<p>Avoid fingering the drawing sheet as much as possible;
in pointing to any part of the drawing use a
pencil and not the finger.</p>

<p>Remember that a drawing is made to be read.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page243">[243]</span></p>

<p>The skill in inking does not depend on the fineness
of the line, but on its clearness.</p>

<p>A soft pencil should never be used on a mechanical
drawing unless in rare cases when it is used for pencil
shading; the hardness or softness of pencils is denoted
by letters.</p>

<p>Never ink any portion of a drawing until the
penciling is entirely finished.</p>

<p>Stretching or pasting the paper to the board is
very seldom resorted to, for the reason that the
mechanical drawings are <i>to scale</i> and the paper is
natural when pinned to the board and more correct
than if under a strain. Mechanical drawings are
always required in practice <i>right away</i>, and time would
be wasted and lost in damping and pasting and drying
again.</p>

<p>A working drawing, whether made to a scale or
not, must have all the dimensions plainly written upon
it, for a workman should never be compelled to measure
a drawing.</p>

<p>In marking off distances, centers, etc., a fine needle
point is useful; the hole should not be punctured
through the paper, merely a prick point, so that it
will leave an impression, which will not be obliterated
by the use of rubber; drawing-pens are often equipped
with such a needle point in the end of the handle,
that is visible only when the pen is unscrewed from
the handle; but in the absence of one of this kind the
point of the divider leg will be of use.</p>

<p>Mechanical construction drawings represent a large
amount of mental and manual work, as well as a considerable
cost in money; hence, they are of value quite
as much as property which has been acquired by the
expenditure of either labor or capital. It is wise to
keep copies of original designs and sketches, as well as
data and formulæ, for record and comparison.</p>

<p>The best system for keeping drawings is to make
them of certain standard sizes, and to keep them flat,
unrolled, in drawers, numbered, lettered and labeled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page244">[244]</span></p>

<p>In an office where space is limited and drawings
have to be rolled it is well to use a number of pasteboard
cases about three feet long and three inches in
diameter. These are shown in <a href="#Fig294">fig. 294</a>.</p>

<p>A puncture can be made near the top and, when a
new drawing or blue-print is inserted in this cylindrical
case, a cardboard tag can be looped through the puncture.
This label will give the title and number of
drawings in that case.</p>

<p>A manuscript book methodically and neatly kept
should tell immediately the number of the drawing
and the case.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig293">Fig. 293</a> is good for practice in line drawing and
also as an optical illusion. “You look and are deceived.
At first glance you say, ‘Of course, those two
lines are curved.’ You are mistaken. They are exactly
parallel. In order to prove this hold them up edgewise
to the eye. It is, of course, the subsidiary lines which
lead the vision astray. It is a case of first impressions
being quite wrong.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Linear Perspective.</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>It should be mentioned that this subject is outside
the limits of mechanical drawing, which only deals
with objects that can be measured, projected or
dimensioned to an accurate scale.</p>

<p>But, in rounding out the more formal subjects it
is well to look a little outside the rigid lines of mechanics
into the methods of nature, for no system of
teaching drawing is complete that does not include
some explanations for sketching from nature&mdash;the
objects being always around the student, the eye
always clear to see and the hand only needing
the training to make permanent the impressions received.</p>

<p>The word perspective means to <i>see through</i>; the
word perspective being derived from the Latin word
<i>perspicere</i>, to look through, hence, perspective is a
science which teaches us to <i>see</i> correctly and enables
us to represent the <i>appearance</i> of anything we may
wish to draw; care should be taken in perspective
drawing, to select objects interesting in themselves, and
the best specimens of their class, so as to cultivate
taste, while they at the same time afford useful and
instructive drawing lessons.</p>

<p>The meaning of the term linear perspective is a
line view; the previous examples have been composed
of surfaces placed fronting the eye; perspective is the
science which treats of the changes of form produced
by viewing them in various oblique positions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page248">[248]</span></p>

<p>The slightest alteration of <i>position</i>
will change the <i>appearance</i>
of an object; this can be easily
shown&mdash;for illustration take a coin,
the actual shape of which is a
perfect round; or, strictly speaking,
a circle. If we take the coin
between the thumb and the first
finger, holding it in an upright
position, and exactly facing the
eyes, as in <a href="#Fig296298">Fig. 296</a>, it appears of its true form, viz., a
circle. If we alter its position, balancing it upon the
thumb, in a level position, with its edge directly opposite
the eye, as in <a href="#Fig296298">Fig. 297</a>, its appearance is changed,
and what we know to be really a circle, appears to us
as a straight line.</p>

<div class="container w40em" id="Fig296298">
<img src="images/illo248.jpg" alt="Perspective" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 296.&mdash;Fig. 297.&mdash;Fig. 298.</p>
</div>

<p>Now, still balancing the coin upon the thumb, but
changing its position with regard to the eye, by holding
it a little lower than in the last position, that is slightly
beneath the level of the eye, as in <a href="#Fig296298">fig. 298</a>, we see both
the edge and the surface, the coin now appearing
neither a circle nor a straight line, but a curved figure
of an elliptical form. Thus the same coin held in three
different positions has assumed three different shapes.</p>

<p>Let us take two coins of the same size, holding (in
the position shown at <a href="#Fig296298">fig. 296</a>) one in each hand. Now,
closing one eye, (which will make the experiment more
clear), hold one coin out
at arm’s length, and the
other at about the distance
of a foot from the eye.
On comparing them, we
find that the coin which
is further from the eye
appears less than the
nearer one. We know that
the coins are really equal
in size, yet one appears
smaller than the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page249">[249]</span></p>

<p>We thus see that when we change the position of
an object, we have as a consequence a change of
appearance; also that the change of appearance may
affect both the shape and the size of the object.</p>

<p>These diversities of appearance may be remarked
in everything around us. We can observe them in the
street by looking at a building from different points of
view, or by comparing the apparent sizes of the street
lamps; in the railway station, by watching the arriving
or departing train; and at sea, by noticing the vessels
as they approach, or as they retire, ultimately vanishing
from our sight in that line where the sea and sky
appear to meet.</p>

<p>All these interesting variations of appearance are
in strict accordance with the laws of <b>GEOMETRY</b> and
<b>OPTICS</b>. The former subject has been enlarged upon
beginning with <a href="#Page81">page 81</a> of this work, where a line, a
point, an angle, etc., are defined; other terms are
explained at <a href="#Page41">page 41</a> and the following pages; to these
we add a few definitions essential to the subject.</p>

<p><b>A PLANE</b> is a surface which is perfectly even and
flat; to use a familiar illustration, a plane is like the
surface of a sheet of plate glass; recollect particularly,
that a surface which is at all curved, is not a plane.</p>

<p>The <b>GROUND-PLANE</b> is the plane on which we
stand; the <i>base-line</i> is an imaginary line passing
through the middle of the feet as we stand square and
erect; and the <i>vertical plane</i> is supposed to stand
on the base-line and perpendicular to it.</p>

<div class="container" id="Fig299">

<p class="caption">Fig. 299.&mdash;See <a href="#Page255">page 255</a>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page250">[250]</span></p>

<p>Planes are parallel to each other when they are
throughout their entire surfaces the same distance
apart.</p>

<div class="container w30em" id="Fig300">
<img src="images/illo250a.png" alt="View plane" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 300.</p>
</div>

<p><b>THE PERSPECTIVE PLANE</b> is an upright square
of glass, usually framed like a picture, with a base, so that
it can stand up alone. This is placed between the eye
of the spectator and the subject to be drawn, and as
the drawing is sometimes made directly upon it, it is
sometimes called the <i>Picture</i> or the <i>Plane of the
Picture</i>.</p>

<div class="container w30em" id="Fig301">
<img src="images/illo250b.png" alt="House" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 301.</p>
</div>

<p><b>HORIZONTAL</b> means perfectly level, like the surface
of still water. We must be careful to understand
perfectly the difference between the terms “level” and
“even” or “flat.” A surface may be even or flat,
without being level. Thus the wall is even and flat,
but it is upright, not level; level means a fixed, constant
position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page251">[251]</span></p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig301">fig. 301</a> a house is shown in perspective in
which the line <i>H L</i> is the line of the horizon and <i>V P</i>
is <span class="nowrap">the,&mdash;</span></p>

<p><b>VANISHING POINT.</b>&mdash;The vanishing point is familiarly
represented by the rails on a trolley track on a
straight road, which seem to approach each other in the
distance, as shown in <a href="#Fig302">fig. 302</a> at <i>V P</i>.</p>

<div class="container w40em" id="Fig302">
<img src="images/illo251a.jpg" alt="Perspective" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 302.</p>
</div>

<p><i>All parallel lines seen in perspective appear to meet
in the same vanishing point.</i></p>

<p>The value of the vanishing point may be seen in
the view of a wooden house, <a href="#Fig303">fig. 303</a>, where it (<i>V P</i>)
gives direction to the retiring lines of the roof, side
planks and door.</p>

<div class="container w40em" id="Fig303">
<img src="images/illo251b.png" alt="Perspective" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 303.</p>
</div>

<p><b>POINT OF SIGHT.</b>&mdash;This is that point in the eye
where the lines or rays from the object cross each
other, as shown at <i>P</i> in <a href="#Fig305">fig. 305</a>, also in <a href="#Fig299">fig. 299</a> at <i>S</i>.</p>

<p><b>VERTICAL</b> means perfectly upright. If we attach
a piece of thread to a weight, a small piece of lead for<span class="pagenum" id="Page252">[252]</span>
example, and hold the thread with the lead hanging
downwards, the thread will fall in an upright or vertical
position.</p>

<p><b>PARALLEL</b> lines are said to be parallel to each
other when they are throughout their whole lengths
the same distance apart.</p>

<p><b>PERPENDICULAR.</b> When one straight line, meeting
another, makes the angles at the point of contact
equal, each of the angles is called a right angle, and
the lines are said to be perpendicular to each other.
Remember especially that perpendicular and vertical
have not the same meaning. Vertical means an unvarying
upright position. Perpendicular means that
one line or plane meets another line or plane at right
angles.</p>

<p>The <a href="#Fig295">fig. 295</a> on <a href="#Page246">page 246</a> is a study in perspective,
showing a water reflection. As rays from every visible
part of the object are reflected, all following the same
law, the reflection will appear to the eye <i>inverted</i>, and
of the <i>same size as the object</i>. The arch itself forms
the upper half of a hollow cylinder, and the reflection
forms the lower half. The reflection shows much
more of the interior of the arch than can be seen
directly. The leaning tree, the boy fishing, and the
receding banks, all are seen in accordance with the laws
of reflection and perspective.</p>

<p><b>THE HORIZONTAL LINE, THE POINT OF
SIGHT AND THE VANISHING POINTS</b> are the principal
items. These should be studied in every room
and during every walk, and the more pleasing accidents
of form stored in the mind or committed to paper for
future use.</p>

<p><b>OPTICS</b>, the science of sight, gives us the following
laws:</p>

<p>1. That we see by the agency of light.</p>

<p>2. That light passes from objects to our eyes.</p>

<p>3. That light travels in straight lines, which are
called Visual Rays.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page253">[253]</span></p>

<p>The human eye may be briefly described as a
chamber of a spherical or globular form, with a circular
opening in front. This circular
opening is called the pupil, and
through it the visual rays pass to
the interior of the eye. The visual
rays, passing from space in all directions
through the small pupil, are
received upon what may be called the interior wall of
the globular chamber forming the eye (see <a href="#Fig305">fig. 305</a>).
This interior wall is called the retina, and upon it the
impressions of external objects are received, just as
they are received upon a screen in a dark chamber.
These impressions are conveyed by the optic nerve
from the retina to the brain.</p>

<p>In front of the pupil is a segment of a small
sphere, composed of the cornea and the aqueous
humor, both of which are transparent, and from their
shape and density have a convergent effect upon the
rays passing through them.</p>

<p>Behind the pupil is the transparent crystalline lens,
which, from its shape and its elasticity, is a powerful
agent in aiding the convergence of the rays, and in
bringing objects at various distances to a clear focus
upon the retina.</p>

<p>The pupil has the power of contraction and dilation,
which is influenced by the quantity of light entering
the eye, but when it is dilated to the utmost its<span class="pagenum" id="Page254">[254]</span>
size is very small in comparison with the great chamber
forming the body of the eye.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig305">fig. 305</a> we have a rough sectional diagram of
the eye and an object in front of it. This object, an
arrow, is seen by means of the visual rays proceeding
from it, the principal two of which are shown. The
visual ray from <i>A</i> passes through the pupil and is
received upon the retina at <i>a</i>. In the same way the
visual ray from <i>B</i> passes through the pupil and is
received upon the retina at <i>b</i>. It will thus be seen
that the impressions or images received upon the
retina are inverted; but, by long reason and experience,
the mind has acquired the habit of determining
the real positions of objects, and does not, though
the image is so received, imagine them to be upside
down.</p>

<p>It will also be observed, in the same way, that that
portion of an object which is upon the right will be
pictured upon the retina upon the left, and <i>vice versa</i>,
but the mind, for the reasons before stated, never
imagines the object to be reversed. This fact is
another proof that, as mentioned at the commencement
of our study, to see accurately is a matter of education
and practice.</p>

<p>And first of Optics; it was asserted, <a href="#Page252">page 252</a>, that
we see by the agency of light which passes from objects
to our eyes in straight lines which are called Visual
Rays.</p>

<p>We see by the agency of light, as all objects,
except such as may be styled self-luminous, when
placed in a dark chamber are not perceivable by us,
except by touch, smell or hearing; we cannot <i>see</i>
them; they are invisible. But when, by removing a
shutter or igniting a flame, we introduce something to
the chamber which was not present when the chamber
was dark, we become at once conscious of the appearance
of the object, we perceive it by the sense of sight.</p>

<p>This something which must always be present to
enable us to see, is called Light; all objects are made
visible to the sense of seeing by its agency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page255">[255]</span></p>

<p>Without light, natural or artificial, it would be
impossible to distinguish one object from another.</p>

<div class="container w30em" id="Fig306">
<img src="images/illo255.jpg" alt="Experiment" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 306.</p>
</div>

<p>That the Visual Rays pass from objects in straight
lines to the eye may be proved by the following
experiment (see <a href="#Fig306">fig. 306</a>):&mdash;Pierce two screens with a
large pin, and place them so that the holes are in a
straight line with a flame, as the light of a candle or
lamp. On fixing the eye to one of these holes we are
able to see the flame; but if we slightly move the
flame, one of the screens, or the eye, the flame is no
longer visible. To be visible, the flame, the holes in
the screens, and the eye must all be in the same straight
line. See <a href="#Fig306">fig. 306</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig299">fig. 299</a> the picture plane is represented by
the rectangle <i>W X Y Z</i>. Although the picture plane
is here shown as a rectangle, it may be of any shape
or of any size.</p>

<p>The observer is at <i>S</i>, looking through the picture
plane at the cross <i>R C O H</i>. The observer is standing
upon a horizontal surface, which is called the ground
plane. If we are in a room, the window may be called
a picture plane and the floor a ground plane.</p>

<p>The picture plane rests, as it were, upon the
ground plane, in a line which passes from <i>Y</i> to <i>Z</i>. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page256">[256]</span>
two planes meet or intersect in this line, which is called
the ground line. The ground line is sometimes called
the picture line, or the measuring line.</p>

<p>The visual rays, by means of which the observer
sees the cross, will, in their course from it to the eye,
pass through the picture plane. These visual rays will
intersect the picture plane in a number of points, and
if we mark the true positions of these points the result
will be a perspective image of the cross.</p>

<p>The rays are shown passing from the cross to the
eye of the observer, and meeting the picture plane in
points <i>r</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>h</i>; <i>r</i> being joined to <i>o</i>, and <i>c</i> to <i>h</i>, we
have the perspective image of the cross as it would
appear to the observer at <i>S</i>. Of course an infinite
number of rays proceed from the cross to the eye
of the observer; but it is quite evident that we need
only consider those proceeding from the extremities of
the object.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Scale or Approximate Perspective.</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>Real, or true perspective, represents the object exactly as it is seen in nature, where the parts that are
far away from the eye of the observer appear smaller than those nearby. Occasions arise, however, in practical
life, with its numerous phases of industrial requirements, where the convenience of showing the complete form
of the object in a single view might preferably be coupled with the convenience of scale dimensions.</p>

<p>This has led to a modified perspective, that sacrifices
some of the accuracy in the appearance of the
object to gain the advantage of scale dimensions; this
form of perspective may be distinguished by the
name&mdash;<i>approximate or scale perspective</i>&mdash;which does not
represent the object exactly as seen in nature, but
where those parts that are afar off are shown of the
same size as those that are near by, and where the
lines that run out into space are parallel to each other
and do not converge into a vanishing point.</p>

<p>To represent an object in perspective, the horizon
and the point of vision will have to appear in the
drawing as the fundamental starting points.</p>

<p>Three dimensions are distinguished for the fixing
of an object in space from a certain reference point.
They are height, breadth and thickness, and are in
their direction square to each other. The height is the
fundamental direction, being derived from the direction
of gravity, that invariably extends to the center of
the earth.</p>

<p>All directions in the perspective determination of
an object are parallel to these.</p>

<p>Vertical lines and planes point toward the center
of the earth, while horizontal planes, including the
directions of breadth and thickness, are square to the
vertical direction. In this, the principal visual ray
extends in the direction of thickness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page258">[258]</span></p>

<p>For a clear understanding of perspective, it must be firmly fixed in mind, that for each prominent point of
the object behind the picture plane, a corresponding point lies in the picture plane, in that position where a
straight line or ray of sight that is going
from the eye to the point of the object,
cuts through the picture plane.</p>

<p>Suppose we could replace these rays
of sight by thin, visible threads of wire
that would go through little holes in
the picture plane, we could then walk
around this bundle of rays, and by looking
at it from three different directions,
we would get three different views of
it. We may look upon it from the top,
from the side or from the end, where the
bundle of rays all concentrate in the eye
of the observer.</p>

<div class="container" id="Fig307">
<img src="images/illo258.png" alt="Viewpoints" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 307.</p>
</div>

<p><a href="#Fig307">Figs. 307</a> and <a href="#Fig308">308</a> show, in two cases, how these three
views would appear. The end views are those where
the perspective picture appears on the plane, while the top and side views only show where the rays intersect
the picture plane. The top view shows how far, for example, point <i>A</i> is distant from
a vertical line <i>O Z</i>, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page259">[259]</span>
the side view shows how far point <i>A</i> is below horizontal line <i>O X</i>, which is at the same height above the
ground as the eye of the observer, <i>O</i>. Thus, all points of the cube can be located on the picture plane, and the
outlines of the cube reproduced in perspective.</p>

<div class="container" id="Fig308">
<img src="images/illo259.png" alt="Viewpoints" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 308.</p>
</div>

<p>Modified arrangements are shown in <a href="#Fig309">figs. 309</a> and
<a href="#Fig310">310</a> for parallel and angular perspective.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page260">[260]</span></p>

<div class="container w30em" id="Fig309">
<img src="images/illo260a.png" alt="Perspective" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 309.</p>
</div>

<p>The views are so arranged in relation to each other
that the picture plane in the top view is parallel to the
horizon and the ground-line, which latter is the intersection
of the picture plane with the level ground of
the end or perspective view. At the same time the
eye of the observer is in one and the same vertical line
for both views, two vanishing points may be found in
the horizon outside of the principal visual ray. To
find the position of these two vanishing points in
the picture plane, the modified top view, <a href="#Fig310">fig. 310</a>, is
used.</p>

<div class="container w40em" id="Fig310">
<img src="images/illo260b.png" alt="Perspective" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 310.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page261">[261]</span></p>

<p>As all lines that end in a vanishing point must be
parallel in reality, this parallelism may be seen in the
top view and lines through the eye of the observer,
parallel to the directions of the main lines of the object,
will cut the picture plane at the vanishing points.</p>

<p>Through these two vanishing points the directions
of two sets of lines are found, the starting points of
which are determined from the plane of measurement.
The third set of lines, being vertical, also appears vertical
and parallel in the picture.</p>

<p>The position of each vertical line is found in the
top view, where the light rays from the observing eye
to the ends of the vertical lines intersect with the
picture plane. Projecting these points down upon the
rays to the vanishing points produces the vertical lines
in the picture.</p>

<p>For example, in <a href="#Fig311">fig. 311</a>, the purpose of perspective
is entirely defeated by placing the eye of the observer
directly in front of the object and arriving at the view
taken in mechanical drawing which needs supplementary
views for complete comprehension of the form of
the object.</p>

<div class="container w40em" id="Fig311">
<img src="images/illo261.png" alt="Defeated perspective" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 311.</p>
</div>

<p>In <a href="#Fig312">fig. 312</a> the eye of the observer is first placed directly
opposite the object, then it sees the object to the
left but a short distance away, while in the third figure
the observer is farther away from
the object. In each case the
picture plane and plane of measurement
is at the front face of
the cube.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page262">[262]</span></p>

<div class="container" id="Fig312">

<img src="images/illo263.png" alt="Perspective" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 312 (second part).</p>
</div>

<p>For such simple objects, it is
not necessary to draw the top view
at all. The only reminder of the
top view is the eye or point of
vision, the picture plane that falls
together for the sake of convenience
with the horizon of the end
view and the ray that determines
the measurement point <i>M</i>, which
is, in this suppressed reproduction,
absolutely necessary, in order to
find the apparent position of the
real corners behind the picture
plane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page264">[264]</span></p>

<p>So far, only square or sharp-cornered objects have
been represented in perspective.</p>

<p>It is evident, however, that round objects can also
be shown in linear perspective, placing reference lines
on the object and representing these as if they were real
lines. A cylinder is thus shown in <a href="#Fig313">fig. 313</a> of which the
end planes will appear very distinctly in sharp outlines.</p>

<div class="container w30em" id="Fig313">
<img src="images/illo264.png" alt="Cylinder" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 313.</p>
</div>

<p>Vertically, only the outlines of the cylinder, as contrasted
against space, will appear as distinct outlines,
while the reference lines will not appear and are therefore
shown only as dotted lines.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig314">Fig. 314</a> shows the approximate or scale perspective
with all the axes drawn and the corresponding angles
and scales marked. The outlines of the object running
in these directions appear all parallel to the axes.</p>

<p>The approximate or scale perspective completely
avoids all the difficulties of choosing a point of sight,
of having several views, vanishing points and measurement
points, and thus offers a representative view, with
a great saving of time and labor. Particularly for
mechanical purposes, where an artistic impression is
not called for, it presents a distinct advantage over the
true or real perspective.</p>

<p>The circumference of every circle whatever, is
supposed to be divided into 360 equal parts, called
<i>degrees</i>.</p>

<p>A degree is <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>360</sub> of the circumference of any circle,
small or large.</p>

<p>A quadrant is a fourth of a circumference, or an
arc of 90 degrees.</p>

<p>A degree is divided into 60 parts called minutes,
expressed by the sign (′), and each minute is divided
into 60 seconds, expressed by (″); so that the circumference
of any circle contains 21,600 minutes, or

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>In the preparation of this work the idea of self-help has never been forgotten;
nothing has been held back or omitted which would, in the author’s opinion, tend
to advance the student in the draughtsman’s art.</p>

<p>The volume contains the experience in practical drawing, as related to engineering
and mechanics, of over one hundred years, i. e., the author’s, Mr. Perrott’s and Mr. Lucas’
experiences added together exceed that period.</p>

<p>Hence, the work should be really helpful; it has been aimed also to be entertaining
and with easy tasks; all the illustrations of the book are recommended as
models for practice&mdash;they have been selected with that view.</p>

<p>Moreover, as between author and publishers, the latter have agreed to issue the
work in the most thorough style possible&mdash;as to paper, printing and binding&mdash;and to
sell it at a very generously low price, considering all things.</p>

<p>With the closing words “hail and farewell,” the author bids adieu (God be with
you) to the reader and the student.</p>

<h2>Transcriber’s Notes</h2>

<p>Inconsistent and unusual spelling, capitalisation and hyphenation have been retained, unless mentioned below. The
discrepancies between the General List of Contents and the structure of the text have not been corrected.</p>

<p>Depending on the hard- and software used to read this text and their settings, not all elements may display as intended.
Where scales are given for illustrations, these can, of course, not be relied upon for measurements.</p>

<p>The numbering of illustrations in the book is inconsistent. Illustrations that have no numbered captions may or may not
be counted; this has not been standardised, except as listed below. Missing illustration numbers have been added only where
they are referenced in the text. The illustrations referred to in the text as Figs. 242 and 243 are captioned Fig. 243 and
244.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

provided that:

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
